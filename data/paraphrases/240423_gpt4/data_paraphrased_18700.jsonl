However, the main problem for modellers is the shortage of data, as we will show. A vital factor in explaining differences in model forecasts is comparing the data on confirmed cases to the model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals who presented symptoms, sought hospital care, underwent testing, and were positively identified as having COVID-19 through DNA or imaging diagnostics. The infected component depicted in transmission models encompasses the entire infected populace. This includes asymptomatic individuals, those without hospital contacts, people with positive lab results, and those misidentified. Thus, the confirmed cases (data) represent just a segment of the overall number of infections (model forecasts). The analogy of an iceberg aptly illustrates the disparity between the data and model forecasts. The whole iceberg signifies the complete number of infected individuals, while the visible tip above water corresponds to the reported cases. The portion submerged beneath the waves symbolizes the unreported infections, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2003; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2018e2019, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2018).What makes this challenging for those developing models? During the calibration of models, specifically when adjusting model outputs like the estimate of the transmission rate b to align with the data on confirmed cases, the total number of infectious individuals, I\u00f0t\u00de, must be adjusted in the model\u2019s forecasts by applying the case-infection ratio r. This adjustment allows for a more accurate projection of confirmed cases. For varying values of this ratio r, the transmission rate b is calculated by aligning the model with the actual data, which consequently determines critical metrics such as the basic reproduction number R 0, the magnitude of the outbreak, and the timing of its peak. Owing to the diverse possible values for the case-infection ratio r for COVID-19, the transmission rate b spans a broad range, leading to a broad spectrum of model outcomes. In the realm of modeling, with given data on confirmed cases, there\u2019s a connective relationship between the ratio r and the transmission rate b, potentially affecting other parameters as well. Numerous pairs of r and b values might closely match the data yet yield vastly different forecasts of the outbreak\u2019s trajectory. This situation is referred to as nonidentifiability within the realm of modeling literature (see, for example, Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2014; Raue et al., 2007; van der Vaart, 1996), indicating that certain model parameters cannot be distinctly determined during the calibration process based on available data. Thus, different parameter selections that fit the data well could result in significantly divergent outbreak predictions. The approach taken to manage nonidentifiability during model calibration profoundly affects the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s forecasts. The conventional nonlinear least squares method struggles with identifying or solving the nonidentifiability problem due to its reliance on basic optimization techniques. These elementary optimization techniques aim to identify a global minimum of the target function, yet countless global minima exist.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

The criteria for selecting models vary when evaluating a large pool of models or when the models under consideration do not fall within a nested structure. For an overview of model selection strategies, we direct the reader to the recent introductory notes by Portet (2020).3. Model selection analysis for an SEIR and an SIR model We used both SEIR and SIR frameworks to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Chengdu, and we applied model selection analysis to decide which framework is more parsimonious. 3.1.

This is especially relevant for COVID-19, where there can be up to a 14-day period before symptoms appear, during which the infected individuals aren't contagious as the virus incubates. It's important to distinguish between the latent period - the time from infection to becoming infectious - and the incubation period - the time from infection to the appearance of symptoms like fever or coughing specific to COVID-19. For SARS, the time to become infectious typically follows two days after symptoms start, according to WHO (2003), indicating a longer latent period compared to the incubation period. In the case of COVID-19, there's evidence from Bai et al. (2020) that individuals may spread the virus before showing symptoms, though the exact duration of the latent period remains uncertain. When compared to the SIR model, the SEIR model provides a more accurate biological representation but introduces two new variables: the duration of the latent period and the initial number of individuals in the latent phase. Figures 1 presents comparative transfer diagrams for the two models, and Tables 1 and 2 detail the parameters' biological implications. A critical assumption for both models is the exclusion of mortality within the S, E, and I compartments as insignificant over the model's forecast span (4 months). The model calibration utilizes newly confirmed case data, aligning with the rI term in both equations, thereby rendering the death rate in the R compartment irrelevant to the model's accuracy.

Here we note the difference between the latent period, which is the period from the time an individual is infected to the time the individual is infectious, and the incubation period, which is the period between the time an individual is infected to the time clinical symptoms appear, which include fever and coughing for COVID-19. For SARS, infected individuals become infectious on average two days after the onset of symptoms WHO (2003); so, the SARS latent period is on average longer than the incubation period. For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020), but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population.

In the case of SARS, individuals typically become contagious approximately two days post-symptom onset as per WHO (2003), indicating the SARS latent period is, on average, more extended than its incubation period. Conversely, for COVID-19, studies (Bai et al., 2020) suggest individuals might spread the virus before any symptoms appear, though the exact duration of this latent period remains predominantly uncertain. When contrasting the SEIR model with the SIR model, the former is noted for its enhanced biological accuracy.

For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020), but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population. The transfer diagrams for both models are shown in Fig. 1. The biological meaning of all model parameters are given in Table 1 and Table 2. A key assumption in both models is that deaths occurring in the S, E, and I compartments are negligible during the period of model predictions. (4 months). Since we use the newly confirmed case data for model calibration, which is matched to the rI term in both models, the death term in the R compartment has no effect on our model fitting.

When including an accurate network setup, like households, schools, workplaces, and community interactions, the \u03b2 value is influenced by the type of contact. The standard transmission probabilities are set at about 0.050 per day for household contacts, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for community interactions. These rates are based on a ratio of 10:2:2:1, selected for (a) alignment with time-use research [53] and infection studies identifying specific contact types [47], and (b) achieving an average weighted \u03b2 value of 0.016, which mimics a well-mixed population where network layers are not distinguished. Considering the default contact frequency in each layer, variations in susceptibility by age, and additional variables, the typical distribution of transmission sources without preventive measures is roughly 30% through households, 25% at workplaces, 15% in schools, and 30% within the community. The \u03b2 value can be further adjusted by implementing measures like social distancing. Moreover, the model permits variations among individuals in disease severity, duration of each disease phase, and levels of infectiousness, which we estimate using individual viral load levels to account for infectivity differences. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u201358]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load for each agent is drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean 1.0 and shape ", "post_context": ", which was the value most consistent with both international estimates [59,60] and fits to data in Washington state and Washington. The per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an agent on any given day is adjusted based on the daily viral load. Figure 2 displays the viral loads for a sample of individuals using standard parameter settings. The ratio of transmissions attributed to people who are asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic changes depending on the situation; for Seattle, these estimated ratios are detailed in [25]. There is conflicting evidence regarding whether the lack of symptoms in an infectious person results in lower transmissibility [55]. Our initial position is that symptom presence does not impact transmissibility, yet we incorporate an adjustable parameter to accommodate different needs within the modeling framework or specific context. This is in light of research suggesting significantly reduced infectiousness in asymptomatic carriers in some cases [61].

Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage.

The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
