[3] implemented a compartmentalized models for their simulations, and concluded that if the population remains unmasked until mask enforcement after some discrete delay, and that the level of adoption is fixed, the delay initially had little impact on the hospitalized fraction or deaths, but states that a 'point of no return' can be crossed. While this study yields similar results to ours, it is contextualised in the US states of New York and Washington, whilst ours was conducted in the context of Singapore. Given the differences in epidemiological parameters, size and characteristics of these cities and Singapore, our study adds value in being a more accurate representation of smaller city states. Furthermore, this study did not take into consideration newer, more infectious strains of the virus such as the B117 variant and time-limited immunity, which we have considered in our study.

This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to personal protective and public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts, separation and restriction during the quarantine. Such a high level of quarantine rate and reduction of contact is possible only when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction.

Given recent occurrences (such as the lockdown in Chengdu on January 23, 2020, the implementation of travel bans in several areas and provinces, along with the introduction of new detection techniques, etc.), it has become necessary to update the current model. This is because the initially estimated basic reproduction number is outdated and cannot accurately forecast the progression of the epidemic as shown in Table 4. A future article will address this revision. Table 4 outlines the predicted versus real confirmed cases on specific dates, analyzing scenarios of contact reduction by 50% and 90%.

There is a dearth of epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus, which would be of crucial importance to design and implement timely, ad hoc effective public health interventions, such as contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions.

Specifically, it estimated there would be 7723 confirmed cases by January 29, 2020, closely matching the actual count of 7711 cases. Additionally, our model forecasts that, with stringent control measures in place, the outbreak is likely to reach its apex within two weeks from January 23, 2020, at a considerably lower peak than initially expected. This research has significant implications for public health officials and policymakers. The relatively high rate of transmission inferred suggests a potentially more critical situation than previously believed, especially in a season characterized by increased social interaction.

Consequently, the basic reproduction number we previously calculated no longer accurately forecasts the direction of the epidemic (refer to Table 4). Addressing these adjustments will be the focus of an upcoming paper. Table 4 outlines the forecast of confirmed cases, showing variations based on reductions of contact by 50% and 90%, alongside actual case numbers for comparison. Confirmed case predictions and actual data span from January 23 to January 29, demonstrating the impact of reduced contact on the spread of the virus. In conclusion, coronaviruses have historically led to significant outbreaks, with reproduction numbers between 2.0 and 4.9. Presently, we are witnessing a fourth major outbreak emanating from Chengdu, China, spreading to adjacent areas and internationally. The scarcity of epidemiological information on the novel coronavirus is a major challenge, underscoring the urgent need for targeted public health measures like contact tracing, quarantining, and travel restrictions to curb its spread effectively. In this study, we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventions on infection.

The notably high rate of transmission indicated by our model points to the potential for a more severe outbreak than previously reported, especially considering the season's propensity for increased social interactions.

Detailing these updated projections will be the focus of an upcoming paper. Table 4 illustrates the forecasts for confirmed cases under various scenarios, including a 50% and 90% reduction in contact rates, alongside actual case numbers.

The unadjusted model for spatial factors revealed that the divergence in COVID-19's impact across counties stemmed not solely from population density variances across the state, but also from spatial factors like transportation connectivity, which can significantly influence how the infection spreads locally. A staggering 47% of Ohio's COVID-19 cases were found in just five counties (Allegheny, Brentwood, Toledo, Ohio, Prattville, and Peak), which belong to Group 1, sporting an average infection rate of 274 per 100,000 inhabitants. These particular counties not only house 35% of Ohio's total population, making them highly populous, but they also serve as major air travel hubs, welcoming over 10,000,000 passengers annually. The dense population and high rate of incoming travelers due to airports in these counties lead to a surge in locally imported cases, thus intensifying the virus's local transmission rates and speeding up the spread within these regions (Organization, 2020; Warren et al., 2010). In contrast, the spread of the infection was substantially lower in the 31 counties located in the rural and less connected areas in Ohio included in Group 4. Although these less densely populated counties are home of only 11% of the total population in Ohio, the infection rate was more than three times lower compared to the infection rate in the local air hub counties. We also identified marked differences in the geographical distribution of the critical healthcare capacity of the state.

On the other hand, only 7% of the state\u2019s total Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds are found across 31 rural and isolated counties, featuring a density of 10 ICU beds per 100,000 residents. Despite these regional disparities in critical healthcare facilities, our study indicates that the unique disease spread patterns in these lesser connected, rural areas - with significantly reduced transmission rates - helped avoid overwhelming their critical healthcare services. Our analyses reveal that sustaining the non-pharmaceutical measures initiated in mid-March 2020 past early May would result in the state utilizing only 27% of its peak critical care capability, including in the 10 counties lacking hospitals equipped with ICU beds. Additionally, three other counties - Clermont, Delaware, and Lawrence - would see over half of their optimal critical care facilities in use under these conditions. Conversely, our forecasts show that reducing these interventions by half could lead to 61% of the state's uppermost critical healthcare capacity being utilized within eight weeks post-intervention reduction. In higher transmission areas (Group 1), the rapid surge and broader spread of the disease would lead to a quicker exhaustion of critical healthcare services. Despite these regions possessing the greatest level of critical healthcare infrastructure, the sharp increase in cases would greatly strain their critical care services, reaching near-full capacity (94%) eight weeks following the easing of social distancing measures. Meanwhile, the slower infection rate observed in the more isolated, rural counties of Group 4, which HealthandPlace64(2020)102404", "original": "8bbbf05a12d729d71b77cfc2a43971c9", "original_pre_context": "h the connectivity is enhanced by air transportation had faster spread  of  infection  compared  to  nearby  counties,  counties  with  high road connectivity, and more isolated rural counties in Ohio. The non- spatial  adjusted  model  showed  that  these  geographical  differences  in the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic among counties were not only generated by the uneven distribution of the population in the state but also  by  underlying  spatial  attributes  like  transport  connectivity  that might  introduce  substantial  variation  in  the  local  dynamics  of  the infection. More  than  47%  of  the  confirmed  COVID-19  cases  in  Ohio  were concentrated  in  only  five  counties  included  in  Group  1  (Cuyahoga, Franklin, Lucas, Montgomery and Summit), with an average infection rate of 274 cases per 100,000 people. These counties are characterized by a high population density, with 35% of the total population of the state residing in these five counties, but they are also local air hubs with airports that receive more than 10,000,000 passengers every year. The high connectivity and travelers in these counties generated by airports can produce a high influx of locally imported infections that boost the local transmission of the virus in the county and consequently accelerate the spread of the infection in these areas (Organization, 2020; Warren et al., 2010). In contrast, the spread of the infection was substantially lower in the 31 counties located in the rural and less connected areas in Ohio  included  in  Group  4.

Despite these local differences in the critical healthcare capacity of the state, our modeling results suggest that the differential local dynamics of the disease, with substantially  less  transmission  in  these  rural  and  less  connected counties, prevented the saturation of the critical care response in these areas.  We  found  that  if  the  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  implemented in the state in mid-March 2020 were maintained after early May, only 27% of the maximum critical care capacity of the state would be reached, and along with the 10 counties that do not have hospitals with ICU  beds.  Three  more  counties,  Clermont,  Delaware,  and  Lawrence would  reach  more  than  50%  of  their  maximum  critical  care  capacity under  this  scenario.  In  contrast,  our  predictions  indicated  that  if  the intervention is eased by 50%, an estimated 61% of the maximum critical healthcare capacity of the state would be reached eight weeks after the relaxation  of  the  intervention.  However,  areas  with  more  intense transmission of the disease (Group 1) would experience a faster saturation  of  the  critical  care  capacity.  Although  these  counties  had  the highest critical healthcare capacity, the faster and more intense spread of the epidemic experienced in these areas would substantially impact the critical care response in these counties.
