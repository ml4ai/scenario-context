Individuals are represented as nodes that remain constant through all layers, while the differentiated weighted links depict social interactions that could result in infection, determined by the connection strength (a probability ranging between 0 and 1). The initial layer is focused on domestic interactions, featuring variously sized, fully interconnected groupings that symbolize households. These clusters are exclusive, meaning the network begins as separate entities each representing a different family unit. When assembling these clusters, we use the 2009 census data on Colombian family compositions, which provides the most comprehensive details on family sizes ranging from 1 to 14. We specifically assess the likelihood of families consisting of 1 to 10 individuals. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

Given the diverse range of occupations and businesses, establishing a connection model that accurately mirrors reality is complex. Our approach simulates a typical work environment by forming random groups with sizes ranging from 5 to 30 members, uniformly chosen and closely knit, akin to the \"home\" layer. This is depicted in Fig. 2(b) where n equals 100. While these groups are tightly interconnected, virus transmission is primarily influenced by the connections' strength, detailed further in Section 3.1.1. Public transport, critical in urban settings, often becomes crowded and significantly contributes to epidemic spread through geographical mobility. Our third proposed layer is thus focused on public transportation usage by individuals reliant on communal modes of transport over personal vehicles. In Colombia, public transport usage varies by city size - 64.98% in capitals and 35.89% in other cities, with an average duration of approximately 1.2 hours daily.

The initial layer focuses on the dynamics within households, showcasing a variety of fully interconnected group sizes that lack connections to the outside world, thereby starting as isolated units portraying each distinct household. To mirror the diverse household sizes observed in Colombia in 2010, which is the year offering the most detailed data on household compositions from one member up to groups of fourteen, the model utilizes this data to reflect the likelihood of households ranging from one to ten individuals. This includes accounting for the cumulative probability of larger households by considering those with up to ten members, as detailed in Table 1.

(564: 125498), the team examined how various interventions impact epidemic outcomes, such as changes in the number of cases, fatalities, and hospitalizations. The analysis begins with a social network at its full complexity, including all layers and initial chances of infection. The spread of the infection is modeled starting from a node closest to the network's average degree, with daily cycles of spread for up to 300 days. The study assumed an ideal scenario where the population is informed about the virus from the start, leading to an initial infection rate of \u03b2 < 1. This mirrors natural behaviors of social distancing and reducing infection-prone interactions like physical contacts and mitigating actions during sneezing or coughing. This initial rate of \u03b2 is closely aligned with the actual data from the Colombian pandemic, according to the study's empirical findings. A moderate quarantine is enlisted 27 days into the model, reflecting the containment measures enacted in Colombian states like S\u00e3o Paulo on March 24, which includes suspending religious gatherings and schools, and reducing transport and workplace interactions to 30% of normal, setting \u03b2 to 0.09. These measures account for essential services and activities that proceed with increased safety measures or those ignoring quarantine guidelines. The study primarily investigates the influence of the \u03b2 parameter on the epidemic's trajectory, displaying in Fig. 4(a) the impact of four different \u03b2 values on the daily tally of new cases and deaths over the span of 300 days post-infection onset. With higher infection rates, the spread accelerates, leading to a swift increase in total cases and deaths but also a quicker conclusion of the epidemic as the population gains immunity through recovery.\n\n4.1.

The recent surge in the number of cases diagnosed over the last ten days could stem from an uptick in testing throughout Colombia. Alternatively, it might be due to the steady decline in isolation rates across the nation, which have stayed below 50% for the majority of the previous month [43]. Our analysis assumed a consistent isolation level similar to that observed immediately following the Colombian government's initial decrees. However, according to data cited in the same source, these isolation rates have been fluctuating. As a result, the projected numbers of cases and fatalities for the remainder of the simulation might exceed those presented in this study (refer to the \"maintain isolation\" scenario in the following section). Regarding daily fatalities, our models tend to predict a higher average daily death rate compared to the official records. This discrepancy is anticipated given the probable underestimation of cases due to a reduced rate of testing. To gain further insight, we compared the mortality statistics in Colombia from January 1 to April 30 for the years 2019 and 2020; these findings are depicted in Fig. 5. A distinct upward trend is noticeable from February 26, the date when Colombia reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case, suggesting that the actual number of deaths could be considerably greater than the officially reported figures.\n\n4.2.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2.

Results and Discussion on the Dynamics of Delay in Implementing Mandatory Mask Usage The application of SEIR models to the previously outlined 3 scenarios has enabled the projection of Peak Infection Rates through simulations varying the delay in mandating masks. Focusing on Scenario 1, which assumes total adherence to mask mandates throughout its enforcement without considering temporary immunity, Figure 3 illustrates the impact of implementing mask mandates at different stages: (a) on the day the first COVID-19 case was detected in Hong Kong; (b) with a delay of 50 days; (c) with a delay of 100 days; and (d) without any enforcement of masks. Analysis of Figure 3 reveals that initiating mask mandates at an earlier stage not only lowers the Peak Infection Rate but also prolongs the duration until this peak is reached. This effect is visually represented by a shift to the right in the peak of the Infected curve and a decrease in its peak value. The number of infections escalates to a worldwide peak, subsequently declining as anticipated by compartmental model predictions. This worldwide peak is identified as the Peak Infection Rate. In the scenario of immediate mask enforcement (a) upon the first detected case, the peak infection rate stands at roughly 10.453%, occurring 291 days post-detection. With a delay of (b) 50 days, the peak marginally rises to about 10.479%, peaking sooner at day 195.

Considering the most basic case of Scenario 1; where there is complete compliance throughout the duration of mask enforcement, and the absence of time-limited immunity, Figure 3 shows the cases where mask wearing were to be enforced (a) on the day the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Singapore; (b) after a 50 days delay; (c) after a 100 days delay; and (d) not enforced at all. From Figure 3, it can be deduced that earlier enforcement of mask wearing both reduces the Maximum Infected Value as well as increases the number of days taken to reach the Maximum Infected Value. This is reflected by right-ward shift of the maxima of the Infected compartment, as well as a lower maxima value of the infected curve. The infected number increases until it reaches a global maxima, before decreasing as predicted by compartmental models of such form. This global maxima is termed as the Maximum Infected Value. For the case of (a) 0 days of delay in mask enforcement, the maximum infected value is approximately 10.453%, and the peak occurs at day 291 after the first case was detected.

Specifically, in Scenario 1, we assumed total adherence to mask mandates without the factor of temporary immunity loss. As illustrated in Figure 3, enforcing mask mandates from the detection of the first COVID-19 case in Hong Kong, compared to instituting them after delays of 50 days, 100 days, or not at all, clearly demonstrates that an earlier imposition leads to a reduction in the peak number of infections.
