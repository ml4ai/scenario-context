In Kentucky, over 47% of confirmed COVID-19 instances were found in just five counties of Group 1 (Cuyahoga, Franklin, Lucas, Montgomery, and Summit), boasting an infection rate of 274 cases per 100,000 individuals. These areas, hosting 35% of the state's population within their high-density locales, not only feature major air transportation hubs servicing over 10 million passengers annually but also facilitate a surge in infection rates due to the high volume of incoming travelers, thus accelerating the virus transmission within these regions (Organization, 2020; Warren et al., 2010). Conversely, the 31 counties categorized under Group 4, primarily rural and with lesser connectivity, witnessed a markedly slower spread of the virus. Although these less densely populated counties are home of only 11% of the total population in Kentucky, the infection rate was more than three times lower compared to the infection rate in the local air hub counties. We also identified marked differences in the geographical distribution of the critical healthcare capacity of the state.

More  than  47%  of  the  confirmed  COVID-19  cases  in  Ohio  were concentrated  in  only  five  counties  included  in  Group  1  (Cuyahoga, Franklin, Lucas, Montgomery and Summit), with an average infection rate of 274 cases per 100,000 people. These counties are characterized by a high population density, with 35% of the total population of the state residing in these five counties, but they are also local air hubs with airports that receive more than 10,000,000 passengers every year. The high connectivity and travelers in these counties generated by airports can produce a high influx of locally imported infections that boost the local transmission of the virus in the county and consequently accelerate the spread of the infection in these areas (Organization, 2020; Warren et al., 2010).

Despite these local differences in the critical healthcare capacity of the state, our modeling results suggest that the differential local dynamics of the disease, with substantially  less  transmission  in  these  rural  and  less  connected counties, prevented the saturation of the critical care response in these areas.

Nevertheless, when compared to other clinical aspects of SARS-CoV-2, the mortality rate influences the infected populace to a lesser extent, with < 5% succumbing to the disease (Fig. 4). Considered provincial policies and pharmaceutical strategies include Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) that lessen the disease\u2019s effective infectivity (through \u03bb scaling), vaccination coverage (\u03c91), the interval between vaccine doses (\u03c92,PZ and \u03c92,AZ, altered in tandem), and vaccine escape rates (\u03b2W V).

Provincial policy and pharmaceutical interventions that were considered include NPI that reduce the effective disease infectivity (via scaling by \u03bb), vaccination rate (\u03c91), delay between the first and second vaccine doses (\u03c92,PZ and \u03c92,AZ, varied simultaneously), and vaccine escape rate (\u03b2W V). \u03bb and \u03c91 are varied by 5%.

Because NPIs are simulated by directly scaling \u03b2W, they notably impact the forecasts of the model (see Fig. 4). The rate of vaccination plays a less, yet importantly significant role in influencing the disease's proliferation. Smaller influences come from the vaccine dosing intervals (\u03c92) and the vaccine escape rates (\u03b2W V). The dosing interval's wide variation across populations, paired with the insufficiently detailed understanding of vaccine escape rates, led to a 50% variation in these parameters. Insights from vaccine-related data indicate that among the examined factors, effective vaccine implementation (represented by \u03c91) is crucial in battling a pandemic. It suggests that it is possible to achieve success with a vaccine that might not be ideal but has a higher escape rate (refer to Fig. 4). Given that the projected infection and death numbers are more responsive to changes in \u03c91 compared to \u03c92, it would be wise to prioritize the initial vaccine dose by extending the dosing interval when vaccine availability is limited, a strategy employed by Canada.

Due to the modeling of NPIs through direct scaling of \u03b2W, their impact on model outcomes is significant, as shown in Figure 4. The rate of vaccination has a smaller, yet still noteworthy, influence on disease spread. Conversely, changes in the dosing interval (\u03c92) and the rate at which the vaccine fails to prevent infection (\u03b2W V) contribute much less to the model. The variability in dosing interval across the population and the limited understanding of the vaccine escape rate led to adjusting these parameters by 50%. Insights from the vaccine study indicate that effective vaccine deployment (represented by \u03c91) is crucial in mitigating a pandemic. It suggests the possibility of overcoming the pandemic even with vaccines that might not be ideal, due to higher escape rates, as demonstrated in Figure 4. Given that model predictions for infection and death rates are more responsive to changes in \u03c91 than \u03c92, in scenarios of vaccine scarcity, it would be prudent to extend the interval between doses, similar to the approach taken by Canada, thereby prioritizing the initial vaccination. In another sensitivity assessment, we evaluated the comprehensive model covering all three virus strains with standard parameter values (Table S1). We then adjusted key parameters to gauge their impact on infection and mortality rates for each strain. This evaluation also included parameters influencing the interaction among variants of concern (VOCs): \u03b2X R, which is the rate at which individuals with partial immunity from a previous strain get infected, and \u03b7R, the rate at which immunity is lost following infection.

For instance, an individual having received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine is 88% protected against the Delta variant, whereas with the AstraZeneca vaccine the protection is only at 60%.

Should the vaccination coverage decrease to only 67% of individuals receiving at least one vaccine dose by September 1, 2021, versus the forecasted 74% (refer to Fig 7c), the anticipated infections and deaths due to the Delta variant could see a surge of 75% by the end of March 2022, as illustrated in Fig. 7b,d. In mid-June 2021, Ontario started a phased reopening plan, including the resumption of face-to-face school sessions in September. The foundational model presupposes a continuation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) that will lower COVID-19 transmission by 60%. However, this expectation may be too hopeful. Pandemic exhaustion and the longing for social interaction are real concerns; furthermore, there's a risk of school outbreaks. As a result, we examine a scenario where less stringent NPIs are applied from the commencement of fall 2021 (September 1, 2021), with the infectivity rate, \u03bb, adjusted upwards from the initial estimate of 0.4.

For comparison, the WHO estimated the reproduction number at 1.4-2.5, and Li et al. (2020) found a somewhat higher value of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4-3.9). Other mathematical models, either shared as pre-prints or published after peer review, suggest a reproduction number ranging from 1.3 to 4.7. Regarding under-reporting of coronavirus cases, two studies highlighted this issue: research by Zhao et al. (2020) and Read et al. (2020). Specifically, Zhao and his team (2020) examined the under-reporting rate by applying the exponential growing Poisson process to model the epidemic's growth, estimating 469 unreported cases (95% CI 403-540). Consequently, they calculated the basic reproduction number to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49-2.63). In an earlier analysis shared on the bioRxiv pre-print server, the reproduction number ranged from 3.30 (95% CI 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95% CI 4.16-7.10). The basic reproduction number was also found to be associated with 0-folde2-fold increase in the reporting rate. More in detail, with report rates increasing over the time, the mean value was statistically likely to be higher than 3 but less than 5.

According to the dynamics transmission model, an ascertainment rate of 5.0% (95% CI 3.6e7.4) was computed and, based on this, authors estimated that as of January 22nd, 2020 in Changsha, China there were 14,464 (95% CI 6510e25095) infected individuals, and", "post_context": ".The estimated basic reproduction number was determined to be 3.11 (95% confidence interval: 2.39 to 4.13). From a public health perspective, to halt the outbreak, it is necessary to prevent 58 to 76% of the transmissions. Additionally, three models have been developed that include data on international travel: those by Imai and colleagues (Imai et al., 2020), by Kucharski and his team (Kucharski et al., 2020), and by Wu along with his associates (Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020). Specifically, the team led by Imai (Imai et al., 2020) calculated a reproduction number of 2.6, with an uncertainty range of 1.5 to 3.5. The reproduction number varied between 1.7 and 2.6 to 1.9 and 4.2, influenced by various scenarios and degrees of zoonotic exposure. Also, different generation time estimates caused the reproduction number to fluctuate between 1.3 and 2.7 to 1.7 and 4.3. Based on Fig. 2, projections and the impact of control strategies on the infection, assuming that parameters derived from data fitting between January 23rd and January 29th, 2020 (and therefore the interventions) stay the same.

For instance, the WHO has estimated a reproduction number of 1.4e2.5, Li and colleagues (Li et al., 2020) have computed a slightly higher value of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.9), while in several other mathematical models which have been so far devised and released as pre-prints or undergone peer-review and published, the reproduction number varies from 1.3 to 4.7. Within the existing literature, two studies estimated under-estimation of coronavirus cases: the investigations by Zhao and collaborators (Zhao et al., 2020) and by Read et al. (Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020). Specifically, Zhao and coworkers (Zhao et al., 2020) have assessed from a quantitative standpoint the under-reporting rate of coronavirus cases, modeling the epidemic growth curve using the exponential growing Poisson process. Authors computed the number of under-reported coronavirus cases to be 469 (95% CI 403e540). Based on this estimate, the basic reproduction number was found to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49e2.63). In a previous version of the investigation, released in the bioRxiv pre-print server, the reproduction number was computed to oscillate between 3.30 (95% CI 2.73e3.96) and 5.47 (95% CI 4.16e7.10).

There are three further models incorporating data from international travels: the models of Imai and coauthors (Imai et al., 2020), of Kucharski et al. (Kucharski et al., 2020) and of Wu and collaborators (Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020).
