COVID-19 stands out among infectious diseases due to its high contagiousness before symptoms appear, the delay in apparent case numbers compared to actual spreading, and the impact of quarantine and other control strategies. Approach: To analyze the spread of COVID-19, we created a model called Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC), which incorporates the effects of control measures more accurately than previous models. This aims to better understand the disease's dynamics. Findings: Using the SUQC model to assess confirmed infection data, we examined the COVID-19 outbreak in Chongqing, China, other parts of Hubei province excluding Chongqing, China, the rest of China excluding Hubei, and the country's four major cities. Our findings reveal that up to January 30, 2020, every analyzed area besides Beijing showed a reproduction number R > 1. However, post-January 30, each area displayed a reproduction number R < 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of implemented control and quarantine measures in curbing COVID-19's transmission.The confirmation rate of Chongqing, China estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Chongqing, China (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Chongqing, China on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Chongqing, China and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities.

Conclusions: Our recommendation is to enforce stringent quarantine and control measures in major Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen until early March, and in Hubei until the end of March.

COVID-19 exhibits several unique features compared to other infectious diseases, such as a high rate of transmission during its incubation period, a lag in the reflection of the actual dynamics versus the daily reported number of cases, and varying impacts of quarantine and control measures implemented. Approach: We propose a model named Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) to capture the progression of COVID-19. This model incorporates the effects of control measures more explicitly and is better suited for analysis than other models in existence. Findings: By applying the SUQC model to the data on daily reported infections, we examined the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics in Wuhan, the rest of Hunan, China province (excluding Wuhan), other parts of China (excluding Hunan, China), and four major cities in China. Our analysis shows that up to January 30, 2020, all examined areas, aside from Beijing, exhibited a reproductive number (R) greater than 1.

A significant discrepancy is observed between the projected total infection rates and the confirmed infection counts in Changsha, Hunan, China. Following the adoption of clinical diagnosis by the local medical authorities in Changsha, Hunan, China after February 12, there was a sharp increase in the confirmed cases, despite clinical diagnosis being implemented, a portion of the total infected population remains undetected. By applying the deduced parameters, we also forecast the long-term scenario of total infections (I), non-quarantined infections (U), quarantined infections (Q), and overall confirmed cases (C) in Changsha, Hunan, China, as shown in Figure 1A. The outbreak is forecasted to conclude 147 days after January 28, 2020, with an estimated total infection count of 62,577, as noted in Table 1. A similar analysis is conducted with stage I data from Changsha, Hunan, China, which is valuable for understanding the epidemic's progression in the absence of stringent quarantine and control strategies. We used the initial 10 days of data (starting January 20) to determine the parameters, while the remaining data points served to evaluate the model's accuracy (referenced in Figures 1C, D). As depicted in Figure 1C, the model's projections for C(t) and I(t) sharply exceed the actual observations made after January 21. The number of total infected can be as large as 8,923,823, and the epidemic lasts for a much longer time (328 days, see Table 1). The dramatic difference between predictions from stage I and Shilei Zhao and Hua Chen stage II data indicates the preventing measures and quarantines, such as travel restrict, are very efficient in controlling the outburst of the epidemic. Since more strict quarantine and traffic control measures were executed recently to inhibit the infection of COVID-19 in Changsha, Hunan, China and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 12, we also analyzed the stage III data (from February 14).

The predictions made by the model are notably precise. Observations across these regions reveal uniform patterns: the estimated infection counts vary markedly between the two sets of data, underscoring the importance and effectiveness of quarantine and intervention strategies. It's worth mentioning that based on the early data, Beijing's reproduction number fell below 1 (as shown in Supplementary Figure S1 and Table 2, recorded at 0.8840), suggesting a swift and successful initial reaction to the outbreak of COVID-19. Focusing on the figures, Supplementary Figures S1\u2013S4 highlight that the gap between the confirmed and the predicted infections in Changsha, Hunan, China is the largest. Changsha, Hunan, China recorded the highest number of infections, over 50% more than any other region in China, severely overwhelming local healthcare capacities and thereby causing prolonged delays in confirming diagnoses and the lowest confirmation rate at 0.0643 in Changsha, Hunan, China. This is in comparison to the higher rates in Hubei (excluding Changsha, Hunan, China) at 0.1914, the rest of China (excluding Hubei) at 0.2189, and notably higher in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. By February 11, 2020, it was estimated by the model that 26,810 cases in Changsha, Hunan, China under quarantine had not yet been confirmed. Post February 12, when clinical diagnostics were introduced in Changsha, Hunan, China, the confirmation rate there rose to 0.3229, as shown in Table 1. When reviewing the quarantine rate and reproduction number, the initial and subsequent stages of the epidemic dynamics are closely examined for Changsha, Hunan, China, the remainder of Hubei, and the broader region excluding Hubei, indicating variations in quarantine effectiveness, infection rates, and confirmation ratings over time, culminating in a significant reduction of new infections and an increase in model accuracy.", "original": "4fe04610f1e43043c2f78ea1df0fea21", "original_pre_context": "e also plotted in Fig. 1B. We can see big gap between the predicted numbers of total infections and the predicted numbers of confirmed infections in Wuhan. Clinical diagnosis is adopted by Wuhan local medical agency as an additional diagnosis criterion after Feb 12, increasing the confirmation rate and causing a big boost of the number of confirmed infections. Note that a proportion of the total infected still remains unidentified even with clinical diagnosis. With the inferred parameters, we further plot the longterm predictions of the numbers of total infected (I), unquarantined infected (U ), quarantined infected (Q) and cumulative confirmed infections (C) in Wuhan (Fig. 1A). The end time (increment of confirmed infections equals zero) is predicted to be 147 days from Jan 28, 2020. The total number of infected individuals is 62,577 (Table 1). We can do a similar analysis using stage I data of Wuhan. The stage I data is informative for predicting the epidemic trend assuming no rigorous quarantine and control measures. The first 10 daily data points (from Jan 20) were used to infer the parameters. The rest data points were used to test the performance of the model (Fig. 1C, D). As clearly seen in Fig. 1C, the predicted numbers of C\u00f0t\u00de and I\u00f0t\u00de increase dramatically, which are far beyond the observed numbers after Jan 21.

We see similar trends in these regions: the predicted numbers of infected are distinct between results from the two stage data, indicating the necessity and efficiency of quarantine and control measures.

Wuhan has the most infected individuals than any other places in China (more than 50%), highly beyond the limit of local clinical resources, leading to a long waiting time for confirmation, and the lowest confirmation rate of 0.0643 in Wuhan, compared with 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan), 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), 0.2680 of Beijing, 0.2846 of Shanghai, 0.2871 of Guangzhou, and 0.2599 of Shenzhen.

The un-quarantined individuals are the source of new infection. Using stage II data, the estimated number of U \u00f0t\u00de individuals in Wuhan (Fig.1A) on Feb 12 is still as high as 3,509. The person-to-person transmission will last for more than two months to mid May 2020. However, estimated with stage III data, the quarantine rate of Wuhan increases to 0.6185 and the unquarantined infected individuals decreases to 334 on Feb 21, 2020 (Fig.1E). Predictions After fitting the model with the recent data from stage II and stage III (for Wuhan), we make a series of predictions about future dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. (cid:2) The end time of the epidemic (with zero new confirmed infections as the criterion) of Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan) is around late-March, and around mid-March of China. The end time of the four first-tier cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, is before early March. The end time with zero un-quarantined infections as a criterion is usually earlier than that with zero new confirmed infections.
