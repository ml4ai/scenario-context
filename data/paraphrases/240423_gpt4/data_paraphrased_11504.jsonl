For example, the WHO calculated a reproduction rate of 1.4 to 2.5. Li and associates (Li et al., 2020) reported a marginally higher figure, 2.2 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.4 to 3.9), while various other mathematical models, both peer-reviewed and released as pre-prints, have shown that the reproduction rate ranges from 1.3 to 4.7. Among the published studies, two specifically addressed the underestimation of coronavirus cases: the research by Zhao's team (Zhao et al., 2020) and the study by Read and colleagues (Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020). In particular, Zhao and his team (Zhao et al., 2020) quantitatively analyzed the underreporting of coronavirus cases by using an exponential growth Poisson process model. They estimated that there were 469 underreported cases of the virus (95% CI 403 to 540). From this data, the basic reproduction number was calculated to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49 to 2.63). An earlier draft of this study, which was released on the bioRxiv pre-print server, had estimated the reproduction number to range from 3.30 (95% CI 2.73 to 3.96) to 5.47 (95% CI 4.16 to 7.10). It was also determined that the basic reproduction number could increase two-fold with every fold increase in reporting rate. More in detail, with report rates increasing over the time, the mean value was statistically likely to be higher than 3 but less than 5. Read and coauthors (Read et al., 2020) used a deterministic SEIR model, assuming coronavirus cases being Poisson distributed and with parameter inference being achieved by maximum likelihood estimation utilizing the Nelder-Mead optimization approach. According to the dynamics transmission model, an ascertainment rate of 5.0% (95% CI 3.6e7.4) was computed and, based on this, authors estimated that as of January 22nd, 2020 in Chengdu, China there were 14,464 (95% CI 6510e25095) infected individuals, and 21,022 (95% CI 11,090e33,490) infections.

Specifically, the study by Imai and colleagues (Imai et al., 2020) suggests a reproduction number of 2.6, with an uncertainty range between 1.5 and 3.5. The reproduction number was shown to fluctuate within 1.7 to 2.6 and then to 1.9 to 4.2 across various scenarios and levels of zoonotic exposure. Similarly, based on different generation time estimates, the reproduction number ranged from 1.3 to 2.7 and then from 1.7 to 4.3.

For instance, the WHO has estimated a reproduction number of 1.4e2.5, Li and colleagues (Li et al., 2020) have computed a slightly higher value of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.9), while in several other mathematical models which have been so far devised and released as pre-prints or undergone peer-review and published, the reproduction number varies from 1.3 to 4.7. Within the existing literature, two studies estimated under-estimation of coronavirus cases: the investigations by Zhao and collaborators (Zhao et al., 2020) and by Read et al. (Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020). Specifically, Zhao and coworkers (Zhao et al., 2020) have assessed from a quantitative standpoint the under-reporting rate of coronavirus cases, modeling the epidemic growth curve using the exponential growing Poisson process. Authors computed the number of under-reported coronavirus cases to be 469 (95% CI 403e540). Based on this estimate, the basic reproduction number was found to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49e2.63). In a previous version of the investigation, released in the bioRxiv pre-print server, the reproduction number was computed to oscillate between 3.30 (95% CI 2.73e3.96) and 5.47 (95% CI 4.16e7.10).

The infectiousness level caused the reproduction number to fluctuate between 1.6 and 2.9. It is presumed that the novel virus would lead to a higher number of mild-to-moderate cases compared to the SARS virus, with a reproduction number estimated at 2.0 (with an uncertainty range of 1.4 to 2.3). The study also indicates that public health measures that block more than 60% of transmission are essential for the effective control and containment of the coronavirus outbreak. Drawing upon the research by Imai and colleagues (Imai et al., 2020) and using a SIR model for analysis, Yu (Yu, 2020) calculated a basic reproduction number of 3.5, asserting that the quarantine rate for the infectious population needs to exceed 90% for successful outbreak management. Moreover, Kucharski and his team (Kucharski et al., 2020) developed a stochastic SEIR model that adapts the Euler-Maruyama algorithm for a 6-hour step and models transmission rate through geometric Brownian motion. The team estimated the time-varying reproduction number via the sequential Monte-Carlo method, tackling data unreliability by analyzing multiple datasets and employing the Poisson probability for accurate, real-time estimations. Transmission was modeled as a random process, fluctuating and varying over the time. Similar to the model of Imai and coworkers (Imai et al., 2020), the risk of transmission and the risk of causing a large outbreak were modeled based on a negative binomial offspring distribution, with incubation and infectious period being Erlang distributed.

The period for the epidemic to double in size was determined to be 6.4 days (95% CrI between 5.8 and 7.1 days). A transmission dynamics model developed by Shen and his team (Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020) estimated that there could be 8042 infections (with a 95% CI ranging from 4199 to 11884) and 898 deaths (95% CI ranges from 368 to 1429), suggesting a mortality rate of 11.02% (with a 95% CI from 9.26 to 12.78%). They calculated an initial reproduction number as 4.71 (95% CI from 4.50 to 4.92), which fell to 2.08 (95% CI from 1.99 to 2.18) by January 22nd, 2020. According to these figures, it is anticipated that the pandemic's spread will decline sharply within 77 days (95% CI from 75 to 80 days) from its inception. The research also indicated that shortening the time from feeling sick or showing symptoms to isolation by one day could potentially lower the peak size of the infected population by 72 to 84% and reduce the overall number of infections and deaths by 68 to 80%. Another study presented by Majumder and Mandl (2020) applied the \"Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment\" (IDEA) model, resulting in an estimation for the reproduction number between 2.0 and 3.1. Additionally, Riou and Althaus (2020), via a stochastic model targeting epidemic pathways, estimated the reproduction number at 2.2 (with a 90% high density range from 1.4 to 3.8). Through exponential growth and maximum likelihood calculations, Liu and associates (Liu et al., 2020) deduced the reproduction number ranged between 2.90 (95% CI from 2.32 to 3.63) and 2.92 (95% CI from 2.28 to 3.67).

This model involves two interlinked populations: humans, acting as hosts, and the pathogens infecting them. It breaks down the human population at any given time, t, into several categories: susceptible (S(t)), exposed (E(t)), asymptomatic but infectious (IA(t)), symptomatically infectious (IS(t)), and recovered individuals (R(t)), while the pathogen level in the environment is represented as P(t).

Similar to predictions made by the basic SIR model, implementing shielding strategies alone could significantly reduce the overall impact of an epidemic, both in terms of diminishing the total number of cases and in curtailing the duration of the peak incidence. For a population of 10 million under a scenario of high virus transmission, the ultimate forecast shows a reduction from 71,000 deaths in the baseline scenario to 58,000 with moderate shielding (\u03b1 = 2) and down to 20,000 with advanced shielding (\u03b1 = 20). In the context of a low transmission scenario within the same population size, the model predicts a decrease from 50,000 deaths at baseline to 34,000 with moderate shielding and further down to 8,300 with advanced shielding. It's noted that the vast majorities of fatalities occur in the over 60 age group, a finding that is in alignment with both prior COVID-19 model projections and observed outcomes from the outbreaks in Italy and Vietnam. These simulations exclusively consider the standalone effect of shielding. However, the implementation of additional measures, like social distancing and stay-at-home orders, would contribute to a further decline in contact rates. The success rate of shielding initiatives hinges on a combination of identifying potential shields and their ability to adequately substitute interactions, essentially \u03b1Rshields, which encapsulates both identification and the amended rate of interaction by those who have recovered. The broader implications of shielding on a population level are influenced by various factors such as demographic makeup, the rate of asymptomatic spread, and how long immunity lasts.

Figure 3 shows the results of comparing shielding interventions to the baseline outbreak. As in  the  simple  SIR  model,  shielding  on  its  own  could  potentially decrease epidemic burden across multiple metrics, decreasing both the total impact and shortening the peak event. In a population of size  10,000,000  for  the  high-transmission  scenario,  the  final  epidemic predictions are 71,000 deaths in the baseline case compared with 58,000 deaths given intermediate shielding (\u03b1 = 2) and 20,000 deaths  given  enhanced  shielding  (\u03b1 = 20).

Our simulation results consider effects of shielding  alone,  whereas  ongoing  restrictions,  such  as  social  distancing and shelter-in-place orders, will help to further reduce interaction rates. The effectiveness of shielding depends on the product of multiplying the number of potential shields identified and their effective substitutability, that is, \u03b1Rshields, combining identification of and interaction rate by recovered individuals. The population-scale effects of shielding relies on multiple factors,  including  demographic  distributions,  the  fraction  of  asymptomatic transmission26,28 and the duration of immunity.

These outbreak models vary according to transmission rates, with and 2.33 representing the low and high ends of transmission, respectively. Reference to early data from Wuhan aligns with a 95% confidence interval for the basic reproduction number (R0), estimated between 2.1 and 4.5.30), putting our high-transmission scenario on the conservative end of estimated ranges. However, the of the high-transmission scenario we examine here is consistent with the range of 2.0\u20132.6 considered in ref. 5, and with the median of (95% CI, 2.04\u20132.77) as R0 \u00bc I estimated via stochastic model fits to outbreak data in Vietnam that account for undocumented transmission28.

Figure 3 displays the outcomes of comparing various shielding strategies against the standard outbreak scenario. Similar to predictions made by the basic SIR model, implementing shielding by itself could significantly reduce the overall epidemic impact, both in terms of diminishing the total number of affected individuals and shortening the duration of the peak incident. For a community of 10 million people under a scenario of high virus transmission, the predicted endpoint shows 71,000 fatalities for no intervention, versus 58,000 fatalities with moderate shielding (\u03b1 = 2) and just 20,000 fatalities with advanced shielding (\u03b1 = 20). In scenarios with low transmission rates within the same population size, the model forecasts 50,000 fatalities without intervention, 34,000 fatalities with moderate shielding, and 8,300 fatalities with advanced shielding. Predominantly, individuals over the age of 60 are the most affected, representing the larger share of fatalities despite being a smaller fraction of the population (as shown in Fig. 3), aligning with findings from other COVID-19 studies and outbreak data from Italy and Vietnam. The simulations only take into account the direct impact of shielding, not considering how measures like social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates might contribute to further lowering contact rates. The success of shielding measures is tied to a combination of factors, including the calculated number of potential shields and their efficiency in substitution (represented as \u03b1Rshields), factoring in both the identification and the interaction rates among immune individuals. The broader implications of shielding on the population level hinge on various considerations, such as demographic makeup, the portion of transmission by asymptomatic carriers, and how long immunity lasts. Our analysis suggests that populations with an age distribution skewed towards older individuals could see disproportionately higher benefits from shielding strategies. This advantage is tempered by the availability of individuals aged 20 to 60 who have recovered and can act as potential shields.", "original": "e195534dc5936158ea4196bb28d156c8", "original_pre_context": "0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 2 5 10 Shield strength, \u03b1 15 20 Fig. 2 | Shield immunity dynamics in a SIR model. a, Infectious case dynamics with different levels of shielding, \u03b1. b, Final state of the system as a function of \u03b1.

COVID-19 exhibits several unique features compared to other infectious diseases, such as high transmission rates during the incubation period, a lag in the appearance of real-time dynamics versus daily reported cases, and the impact of interventions like quarantine and other control measures.Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hunan (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hunan) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hunan excluding Wuhan (", "post_context": "), and that of China excluding Hunan (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines.On February 12, 2020, Wuhan reported an estimated 3,509 cases of unquarantined infections, which decreased to 334 by February 21, 2020. By analyzing the data available up to February 21, our model forecasts the COVID-19 outbreak's conclusion in Wuhan and Hunan by late March, by mid-March for the rest of China (excluding Hunan), and before the beginning of March for the four major cities. In total, there are an estimated 80,511 infected individuals across China, with 49,510 in Wuhan, 17,679 in the rest of Hunan (excluding Wuhan), and 13,322 from other parts of China (excluding Hunan). These predictions come from a deterministic ODE model, and there's a degree of uncertainty in these estimates. In light of these findings, we advise that strict quarantine and control efforts continue until early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, and until late March in Hunan. This model could also serve to forecast the trend of the epidemic and offer numerical guidance for other nations facing a high risk of an outbreak, like South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. Keywords: coronavirus disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2; epidemic model Summary by the author: The COVID-19 virus is currently expanding rapidly across China and over 30 other countries within the past two months. This virus shows unique traits compared to other infectious diseases, such as high transmissibility during its incubation period, a delay in the reflection of actual dynamics in daily confirmed case numbers, and the impact of quarantine and control initiatives. We have introduced a SUQC model to capture the COVID-19 dynamics effectively. The SUQC model, leveraging the latest data from China, aims to predict the epidemic's trajectory and offer strategic insights for countries facing imminent threats, including South Korea, Japan, and Iran.

A SUQC model has been developed to understand COVID-19's dynamics, applied to daily updated data from India, aiming to forecast the outbreak's trend.
