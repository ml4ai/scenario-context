The significant difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the past ten days could be attributed to the increased testing in Argentina, or possibly the consistent decline in isolation levels in the country (with levels below 50% for most days in the past month) [43]. We assumed a fixed isolation level based on the initial days following government decrees in Argentina, but data indicates that these levels are continuously changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the future simulations may be higher than those reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section). In terms of daily death toll, the average figures from our models are higher than the official numbers. This is to be expected given the likelihood of underdetection due to limited testing. To further comprehend this, we analyzed the number of deaths in Argentina from January 1 to April 30, comparing statistics between 2019 and 2020; the results are illustrated in Fig. 5. A clear upward trend is noticeable after February 26, the date of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Argentina, suggesting that the actual death toll may be substantially higher than reported figures.

Observing Figure 3, it is evident that earlier implementation of mask wearing not only reduces the Maximum Infected Value but also delays the peak number of infected cases. This results in a rightward shift of the peak of infections and a lower overall peak value. As expected from compartmental models, the number of infected cases rises until a global maximum is reached before declining. For example, with no delay in mask enforcement (a), the maximum infected value is about 10.453% on day 291. With a 50-day delay (b), the maximum infected value is around 10.479% on day 195. However, with a 100-day delay (c), the maximum infected value increases significantly to approximately 27.474% on day 103, similar to the scenario where no masking is enforced (d).", "original": "b6d74dfbedfa805b659e1d543d58ea0a"}

The suppression scenario had lower mortality, restriction day index, and health care intensity compared to the mitigation scenario. Additional scenarios looked at permanent strict restrictions, mild restrictions from the start, and relaxation of restrictions, each predicting different epidemic outcomes. See Figure 2 for a snapshot of the model's output illustrating the timeline of a mitigation strategy.The results are for a single simulation run, not an average of an ensemble.

This can be observed in Figure 3 and summarized in Table 3, which present sensitivity analyses regarding contact rate (c) and quarantine rate (q) on the log number of infected individuals and cumulative reported cases. Additionally, Table 3 also highlights the effects of travel restrictions on the peak time and peak value for different values of c and q. The baseline values are noted as (c, q) = (14.78, 1.88 \u00d7 10 11.4 days 1.38 \u00d7 104 \u22127).", "original": "75c834e6f04c6c671c1f57bab9130801"}

Estimations in these situations heavily rely on specific datasets used, and revising/updating them could impact results.

The finding of a high reproduction number suggests the potential for a severe epidemic without prompt public health interventions, especially during a period of increased social contacts. The serial interval significantly affects the accuracy of likelihood function estimation, with the incubation period of Hangzhou patients with coronavirus pneumonia reported to be 2 to 15 days.

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

Achieving such a high level of quarantine rate requires strong public health infrastructure and strict adherence to personal protective measures and public health interventions. This includes reducing effective contacts, implementing separation measures, and imposing restrictions during quarantine. Such stringent measures are only possible when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, highlighting the importance of travel restrictions.

Small fluctuations in these parameters (5%) can lead to significant changes in infection and mortality rates, as demonstrated in Figure 4. The mortality rate of COVID-19 impacts the pool of infected individuals who can contribute to disease transmission. Because COVID-19 mortality rate can vary substantially depending on health care infrastructure, we varied \u03bcW I by 50%. As expected, changes in \u03bcW I are immediately reflected in the number of deaths. However, compared to other clinical features of SARS-CoV-2, the mortality rate has a relatively small effect on the infected population, since < 5% of them die (Fig. 4).

According to the dynamics transmission model, an ascertainment rate of 5.0% (95% CI 3.6e7.4) was computed and, based on this, authors estimated that as of January 22nd, 2020 in Wenzhou there were 14,464 (95% CI 6510e25095) infected individuals, and 21,022 (95% CI 11,090e33,490) infections.

It was estimated that the novel virus would lead to more mild-to-moderate cases compared to the SARS virus, resulting in a reproduction number of 2.0 (with uncertainty ranging from 1.4 to 2.3). Research indicates that public health interventions blocking over 60% of transmission are crucial in controlling the coronavirus outbreak. Different studies have estimated various reproduction numbers and recommended different quarantine rates for effectively managing the outbreak. Kucharski and colleagues developed a stochastic SEIR model to provide real-time estimates, utilizing various datasets to address data reliability concerns and relying on Poisson probability calculations. Transmission was modeled as a random process, fluctuating and varying over the time. Similar to the model of Imai and coworkers (Imai et al., 2020), the risk of transmission and the risk of causing a large outbreak were modeled based on a negative binomial offspring distribution, with incubation and infectious period being Erlang distributed.

It is suggested that the increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly may have contributed to these trends.

Introduction: Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from mild to severe, such as SARS. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and quickly became a global health crisis. This study aimed to develop a modified SEIR mathematical model to predict the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic and determine effective intervention strategies. Numerous researchers have utilized mathematical modeling techniques to understand and predict the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus.", "original": "3d479fb61a6401bf16f9cf209c9a0a56"}

Research has shown that COVID-19 can spread through human-to-human contact and from the environment to humans. Infected individuals, both with asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) cases, can transmit the virus to susceptible individuals S(t) they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without proper precautions, the virus can spread into the environment. As the pathogen can survive in the environment for several days, individuals in close proximity are at risk of exposure, especially during the early stages of the outbreak before hygiene practices are established. The spread of the disease begins as susceptible individuals move to the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period in the host. The exposed individuals then transition to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious populations. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens during human interaction at time t. Most infectious individuals recover and join the recovered population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is shown in Figure 1. The parameters utilized in the COVID-19 transmission model can be found in Table 1. This model results in a six-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, as depicted in Figure 1, illustrating the SEIR-P model of COVID-19 transmission.", "original": "3a10066fb61f464b3fccbb314e8488b9"}

Thorough simulation studies were also performed to examine these interactions. \n\nThe study involved the formulation of a mathematical model to analyze the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This model considered two populations: humans as hosts and pathogens. The human population was divided into susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic infectious, symptomatic infectious, and recovered individuals. The pathogen in the environment was also taken into account. \n\nResearch has shown that the virus can be transmitted through human-to-human contact as well as from the environment to humans. Data from epidemics indicated that both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals could spread the COVID-19 virus to susceptible persons they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals sneeze or cough without taking the necessary precautions, the virus can also spread to the environment.Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented. In  the  process  of  disease  spread,  the  susceptible  individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5].

In this model, the constants \u03b11 and \u03b12 represent the frequency at which individuals acquire COVID-19 from their environment and from infected individuals, respectively.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 presents unique characteristics compared to other infectious diseases, such as high infectivity during the incubation period, a time delay between actual dynamics and daily confirmed cases, and the impact of quarantine and control measures on its spread. To better understand these dynamics, we have developed a Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model, which takes into account the intervention effects of control measures.

Each scenario simulated the impact of a specific social distancing policy on response variables, with 35 executions and 1,440 iterations each.Since each iteration corresponds to one hour, each exe- cution covers exactly 2 months and one complete accounting cy- cle for houses, government and business, with one salary and tax payment, which occur in the 30th day of the month.

The lack of data is a significant issue for modellers, as understanding the relationship between confirmed cases and model predictions is crucial. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. The infected compartment in transmission models represents all infected individuals, including those with and without symptoms, contacts with hospitals, confirmed lab tests, and those who may be misdiagnosed. Confirmed cases are just a fraction of the total infected population predicted by the model - a metaphor of an iceberg illustrates this well, with the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface representing the cases data and the part hidden under the water symbolizing the undetected infected population, known as the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2. In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC.\nWhy is this a problem for modelers? When calibrating a model to estimate key parameters like the transmission rate b by fitting it to confirmed case data, it is crucial to adjust the total number of infectious individuals I(t) using the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed cases. Different values of r can result in varying estimates of the transmission rate b, which in turn affects the basic reproduction number R0 and the timing of the epidemic peak. The wide range of potential values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19 leads to a wide range of estimated transmission rates b and, consequently, a wide range of model predictions. This nonidentifiability phenomenon, where multiple sets of parameters can fit the data equally well but lead to different predictions, poses a challenge in model calibration. Traditional methods like nonlinear least squares may struggle to address nonidentifiability due to their basic optimization algorithms. How nonidentifiability is managed during model calibration significantly impacts the reliability of model predictions.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

The dashed lines in the figure indicate the 95% prediction intervals for the progression of the epidemic after the lockdown. The simulations begin on January 20, 2021. Medical experts suggest that the initial basic reproduction number (R0) for the COVID-19 outbreak in Nanjing was around 2. Our findings, as shown in Figure 4, align with earlier estimates and the current consensus. Even without additional control measures implemented after February 7, the lockdown and travel restrictions in Nanjing effectively slowed down transmission, resulting in a control reproduction number (Rc) with a mean value of 1.629. The impact of further control measures will be evaluated in Section 6. Different scenarios of the diagnosis rate (r) were considered to account for varying assumptions about the case-infection ratio and the scale of the epidemic in Nanjing.

Additionally, we allow for differences in disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and individual infectiousness, using individual viral load to model variations in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

Figure 2 shows viral loads for a sample of individuals with default parameter values. The distribution of transmissions among asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by location; estimated proportions for Seattle are provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced if the infected individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted based on the specific modeling needs or context, acknowledging that some studies have suggested lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e"}
