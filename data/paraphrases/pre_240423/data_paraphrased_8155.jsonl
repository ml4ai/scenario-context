These groups do not have external connections, reflecting disconnected family units. The distribution of family sizes in Peru in 2009 is used to create these groups, with probabilities considered for families of sizes 1 to 10. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

In any country, a significant portion of the population must engage in work or economic activities, requiring interaction with others. This makes work a crucial aspect of social relations, especially during an epidemic. To represent this, we suggest a generic layer connecting individuals aged 18 to 59, encompassing 60% of the population in Peru. Given the diverse range of jobs and companies, creating connection rules reflecting the real world accurately is complex. Our approach involves randomly formed groups of sizes ranging from 5 to 30, with internal connections resembling the \"home\" layer. An illustration of this layer is depicted in Fig. 2(b) for n = 100 individuals. Transmission of the virus within these groups is influenced by edge weights, which are examined further in Section 3.1.1. Public transportation is vital in cities, serving as high-density environments prone to geographical spread in an epidemic. The third layer we propose models public transportation, catering to individuals without personal vehicles. In Peru, the use of public transport varies based on city size, with 64.98% in capitals and 35.89% in other areas. On average, individuals spend 1.2 hours a day on public transport. Considering a 50% participation rate in this layer, random groups of sizes between 10 and 40 are formed, with fully connected nodes within each group.", "original": "43497a975dec6998de7cf3e8e7a0fa4d"}

Key clinical parameters can be derived from relevant clinical data, such as from sero-epidemiological surveys, and the potential for infection spread from asymptomatic cases has recently been highlighted. The high reproduction number found in our study suggests a serious epidemic could occur without prompt public health interventions, especially during peak social contact seasons. The serial interval plays a crucial role in the accuracy of likelihood function estimation, and in the case of Hangzhou coronavirus patients, the reported incubation period ranges from 2 to 15 days.

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snow/ice melt; Climate change.\n\nIntroduction\nMany global coupled climate models included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012) have failed to accurately replicate observed climate trends in the Southern Ocean, such as surface cooling, freshening, and sea ice expansion (Turner et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2016; Kostov et al. 2018). The increase in Antarctic meltwater anomaly over recent decades may have influenced these trends significantly (Rye et al. 2020). Climate models commonly overlook the anomalous freshwater flux resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been steadily increasing to around 500 Gt yr 2019 (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019). Recent research suggests that integrating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help reconcile the disparities between observations and simulations, shedding light on the observed trends (Bintanja et al. 2013; Rye et al. 2014; Bintanja et al. 2015; Rye et al. 2020). The inclusion of Antarctic glacial meltwater in climate models could have a significant impact.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

Therefore, for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Research has indicated that the virus can spread in two ways: from human to human and from environment to human. The data from epidemics shows that both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) individuals can transmit the COVID-19 virus to susceptible individuals S(t) they come in close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without proper precautions, the virus can spread to the environment they are in. As the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for some time, susceptible individuals S(t) in close proximity to this environment are at a higher risk of exposure, particularly in the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak before hygiene measures are put in place. During the spread of the disease, a susceptible individual transitions to the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period of the virus. The exposed individual then progresses to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious population. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present when human beings interact at time t. The majority of infectious individuals recover and move to the recovered human population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is presented in Fig. 1.

Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Our prediction indicates that without any interventions, over 14 million individuals would have died by May 17, 2020. Intervening just one week earlier could have prevented 280,000 deaths globally. We observe that restrictions on mass gatherings and school closures resulted in the most significant reductions in infection rates, at 29.6% and 17.3% respectively. The strictest policy, staying at home, led to an average reduction in infection rates of 74.4% compared to baseline for countries that implemented it. Additionally, we demonstrate how our epidemiological model, DELPHI, can forecast future COVID-19 cases under different government policies. Janssen Pharmaceuticals used this analysis to choose locations for its Phase III trial of the Ad26.Cov2.S vaccine. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with over 530 million cases and 6.3 million deaths as of June 1st, 2022, is the most deadly in recent history.

The lack of data is a major concern for modelers, as it can greatly affect predictions. Understanding the relationship between confirmed cases and model predictions is crucial. Confirmed cases are individuals with symptoms who were tested and diagnosed with COVID-19, while the infected compartment in transmission models includes all infected individuals, symptomatic or not. Confirmed cases represent only a fraction of the total infected population, similar to the tip of an iceberg above the water's surface. The hidden population of infected individuals, not captured in the data, is like the submerged part of an iceberg, known as the hidden epidemic.The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2040; Gumel et al., 2040; Lipsitch et al., 2039; Zhang et al., 2045). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2040, the", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2040).Why is this a concern for modelers? When calibrating a model to estimate key parameters like the transmission rate b by fitting the model output to confirmed cases data, it is necessary to adjust for the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), using the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed case data. Different values of r will result in different estimates for the transmission rate b, which in turn affects the basic reproduction number R0, the scale of the epidemic, and the peak time. The wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19 leads to a wide range of estimated transmission rates, resulting in a wide range of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, can make it difficult to uniquely determine model parameters from the available data during calibration. Different combinations of r and b that provide a good fit to the data can yield very different epidemic predictions. The way nonidentifiability is addressed during model calibration significantly impacts the reliability of the predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is not effective at detecting or addressing nonidentifiability, as it relies on basic optimization algorithms that may not find the global minimum of the objective function.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Recovery times differ for asymptomatic, mild, and severe cases, as outlined in Table 1. In the model, non-critical cases are expected to recover, while critical cases may recover or succumb, with the likelihood of death rising with age (Table 2). When a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious person, there is a probability of virus transmission (\u03b2) in the population. A value of \u03b2 = 0.016 in a well-mixed community with an average of 20 daily contacts per individual corresponds to a doubling time of approximately 4-6 days and an R0 of about 2.2-2.7, with specifics varying based on population size, age demographics, and other factors. The default value of \u03b2 = 0.016 in Covasim was determined through data calibration from Washington and Oregon states.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8.

In the absence of interventions, transmission events are estimated to occur approximately 30% through households, 25% through workplaces, 15% through schools, and 30% through the community. Interventions such as physical distancing can modify the transmission rate. Individual infectiousness is allowed to vary based on viral load, with higher levels typically seen around symptom onset. We model two stages of viral load, with the high stage lasting for a shorter period but with twice the intensity of the low stage. The default viral load is determined by a negative binomial distribution, with values consistent with international estimates and data from specific regions. Daily viral load is used to adjust the transmission probability for each individual.

The default transmission probabilities are approximately 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values were chosen to maintain consistency with time-use surveys and research on infections with known contact types, resulting in a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value.

The value of \u03b2 can be influenced by interventions like physical distancing. Furthermore, we allow for differences in disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and individual infectiousness based on variations in viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an individual is adjusted based on their daily viral load. Fig 2 displays viral loads for a sample of individuals with default parameter values. The distribution of transmissions among asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies depending on the context, with estimates for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether an infectious individual without symptoms has lower transmissibility [55]. Our default assumption is that they do not, but we include a parameter that can be customized for different modeling applications or settings. Some research suggests much lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e"}
