This is demonstrated by a shift to the right of the peak of the Infected compartment and a lower maximum value of the infected curve. The number of infected individuals increases until it reaches a global maximum before decreasing, in line with compartmental models.

In contrast, with a (b) 50-day delay, the maximum infected value is around 10.479%, and the peak is on day 195.

The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs", "post_context": ").Furthermore, the study considered three additional scenarios. One scenario involved the long-term implementation of the current strict mobility restrictions (50%), leading to a projected suppression of the epidemic by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also depicted in Figure 4). The other two scenarios explored the effects of mild restrictions from the outset (25%) or the relaxation of restrictions before summer (increased to 30%), both resulting in a significant increase in the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). The results shown in Figure 2 illustrate the timeline of a mitigation strategy, including the addition of new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and only testing severe cases. This strategy resulted in 660,000 recovered patients at the end of the one-year simulation. In Figure 3, the timeline of a suppression strategy is detailed, with an initial 50% reduction in mobility that later decreased to 20-25%, along with aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing. This approach led to 77,000 recovered patients after one year. It is important to note that these results are based on a single simulation run, not an average of multiple simulations.", "original": "c292ac4164c474f46812c536de11dcbe"}

The threshold values for contact rate and quarantine rate, as shown in the contour plot of R_c = 1, highlight the challenging requirements for a city to avoid an outbreak. Achieving this high threshold rate of quarantine demands robust public health infrastructure and strict adherence to personal protective measures by the citizens, including reducing contact, quarantining, and implementing public health interventions. This level of quarantine and reduction of contact is only feasible when imported cases from the epicenter are minimal, underscoring the importance of travel restrictions. However, implementing strict travel restrictions to Shanghai is costly and resource-intensive, posing a significant challenge to decision-makers and the city's resilience.

The mean and variance of the prior for each parameter were selected to create a symmetric 95% Bayesian credible interval that matched the plausible ranges for each parameter. We chose a multivariate normal distribution as the prior to address both modeling and tractability concerns. The distribution needed to be unimodal with ellipsoidal contours for the analysis. Random sets of parameters were sampled from this prior, adjusted to ensure feasible values for positive or bounded parameters, and used to form a prior distribution for infections considering parameter uncertainty. Our simulation showed that 2\u00d7/wk testing can effectively control infections in most scenarios, but large outbreaks can occur in certain cases. To assess the impact of interventions like testing under parameter uncertainty, we created a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with varying levels of pessimism about infection numbers.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

Therefore, for the human population, we can express N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Research has indicated that COVID-19 can be spread in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Infected individuals, both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t), transmit the virus to susceptible individuals S(t) with whom they come into close contact. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without taking proper precautions, the virus can spread to the surrounding environment. Given that the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for several days, individuals in close proximity to these environments may be exposed to the virus, especially during the early stages of the outbreak before hygiene practices are established. As the disease spreads, susceptible individuals transition to the exposed population E(t) due to an incubation period. From there, the exposed individuals can move to either the asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious populations. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interactions at time t. The majority of infected individuals recover and move to the recovered human population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is depicted in Figure 1. The parameters utilized in the COVID-19 transmission model can be found in Table 1.

For a low-transmission scenario in the same population size, the model predicts 50,000 deaths in the baseline case, 34,000 deaths with intermediate shielding, and 8,300 deaths with enhanced shielding. Despite a lower proportion of individuals in older age groups, most deaths occur in individuals aged 60 and older, consistent with other COVID-19 models and data from outbreaks in Italy and Japan. \n\nOur simulation specifically examines the impacts of shielding measures, while ongoing restrictions like social distancing and shelter-in-place orders will further reduce interaction rates. The effectiveness of shielding depends on the number of potential shields identified and their ability to effectively replace interactions, denoted as \u03b1Rshields. The overall impact of shielding on a population is influenced by various factors such as demographic distributions, the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, and the duration of immunity. Populations with a higher proportion of older individuals may benefit more from shielding. Though there may be fewer recovered individuals in certain age groups, enhanced shielding measures can still have a significant impact.", "original": "c42e4f1d5aaa7dbc5c167f58729e4978"}

Following revisions on March 4, 2020, it was accepted. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China and more than 30 countries in the past two months. COVID-19 exhibits unique characteristics compared to other infectious diseases, such as high infectivity during the incubation period and a time delay between actual dynamics and daily confirmed cases. Additionally, the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures play a crucial role. A Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model was developed to capture the dynamics of COVID-19, explicitly incorporating the intervention effects of control measures for better analysis compared to existing epidemic models. Application of the SUQC model to daily confirmed infection data revealed insights on the COVID-19 outbreak in various regions in China. The findings indicated that prior to January 30, 2020, all regions, except Beijing, had a reproductive number (R) greater than 1. However, after January 30, all regions had an R less than 1, signaling the effectiveness of quarantine and control measures in curbing the spread of COVID-19.

A set of ODE equations is utilized to model the dynamics of infectious diseases and the control by artificial factors.

Parameters such as T (mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation), w (mean time delay from isolation to confirmation), and R (reproductive number of infection) can be defined from the model.

However, a lack of data poses a greater concern for modelers. An important factor influencing the variability in model predictions is understanding the relationship between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical care, were tested, and confirmed to have COVID-19. The infected compartment in transmission models includes all infected individuals, whether symptomatic or not, who may or may not have sought medical attention, as well as those with confirmed cases and those who may have been misdiagnosed. Essentially, confirmed cases (data) only represent a portion of the total infected population (model predictions), akin to the tip of an iceberg above the sea surface representing a fraction of the whole iceberg. The submerged part of the iceberg symbolizes the infected individuals not captured by public health surveillance and testing, known as the hidden epidemic.The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021).Why is this a challenge for modelers? When calibrating a model to estimate key parameters such as transmission rate (b) by comparing model output to confirmed cases data, it is necessary to account for the total number of infectious individuals (I(t)) by applying the case-infection ratio (r) to accurately predict confirmed cases. By adjusting the ratio r, the transmission rate b can be estimated and used to determine the basic reproduction number (R0), epidemic scale, and peak time. However, the wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio r for COVID-19 results in a wide range of estimated transmission rates b, leading to a wide range of model predictions. This nonidentifiability issue, where multiple combinations of parameter values can fit the data well but result in significantly different predictions, poses a challenge in model calibration. The approach taken to address nonidentifiability during calibration greatly impacts the reliability of model predictions. Traditional optimization algorithms, such as nonlinear least squares, may struggle to detect or resolve the nonidentifiability issue effectively, as they aim to find a global minimum without considering the possibility of multiple global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

In our model, we account for this variability by assigning different recovery times for asymptomatic cases, mild cases, and severe cases, as outlined in Table 1. Non-critical cases are expected to recover, while critical cases may recover or result in death, with the likelihood of death rising with age (Table 2). In terms of transmission and viral dynamics within the host, when a susceptible person interacts with an infectious individual, the virus is transmitted with a probability denoted as \u03b2. In a population with an average of 20 daily contacts per individual, a \u03b2 value of 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of around 4-6 days and an R0 of approximately 2.2-2.7, although the exact values depend on factors such as population size and age structure. This value of \u03b2 = 0.016, currently utilized in Covasim, was determined based on data from Washington and Oregon states.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8.

In the absence of interventions, transmission events are distributed approximately 30% through households, 25% in workplaces, 15% in schools, and 30% in the community. Interventions, like physical distancing, can impact the value of \u03b2. Individual differences in disease severity, time spent in different disease states, and infectiousness are considered. We model viral load variations, with a focus on two stages - early high and longer low - with the high stage lasting for 30% of infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load is determined by a negative binomial distribution with a mean of 1.0 and shape parameter 0.45.

Differentiation in disease severity and time spent in each disease state, as well as varying individual infectiousness levels, are modeled through individual viral load variations. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

Viral loads for a sample of individuals with default parameter values are depicted in Fig 2. The distribution of transmissions among asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the situation, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced in cases where the infectious individual lacks symptoms [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted as necessary for specific modeling scenarios or contexts, acknowledging that some studies have utilized much lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].
