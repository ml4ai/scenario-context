The study simulated a social network with initial infection probabilities and found that the virus starts spreading from a node with a degree close to the average network degree. The simulation considered a best-case scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in a lower initial infection probability (\u03b2 < 1) over a 300-day period. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 23 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39].

A higher infection rate results in a faster spread of the disease and more cases and deaths.

The simulation begins with a social network incorporating all layers and original infection probabilities. Infection originates at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spreads in daily iterations over 300 days. The study assumes an optimistic scenario where individuals are aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1. This implies natural social distancing and precautionary measures like avoiding close contact and proper hygiene practices. The empirical findings suggest that this initial \u03b2 value correlates well with the Argentine pandemic situation. After 27 days, a moderate quarantine is imposed, mirroring the isolation measures introduced by Argentine states like Buenos Aires on March 24. This quarantine involves removing certain social layers and reducing contacts in other areas to 30% of their original values (i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09). Essential services and activities with increased precautionary measures continue under these restrictions. Fig. 4(a) illustrates the impact of different \u03b2 values on the epidemic curve in terms of daily new cases and deaths over a 300-day period.

The model shows a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation. The increased number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be due to the rise in tests being conducted in Argentina, or possibly the consistent decrease in isolation levels in the country (remaining below 50% for most days in the past month) [43]. We assumed a fixed isolation level similar to what was observed in the initial days after government decrees in Argentina, but data from the same source indicates these levels are constantly changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the rest of the simulation could be higher than reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). In terms of daily death toll, the average number in the proposed models is higher than that of official numbers, which is expected due to potentially higher underdetection rates with fewer tests being conducted. To further understand this, we analyzed the number of deaths in Argentina from January 1 to April 30, comparing data between 2019 and 2020, as shown in Fig. 5. The data illustrates a clear upward trend after February 26, the day of Argentina's first confirmed COVID-19 case, suggesting that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than what's officially reported.\n\nLooking ahead, after the initial phase of the epidemic, we consider four potential actions that could be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) Maintain current isolation levels without additional measures; b) Lift isolation measures, returning to normal activities with initial network layers and weights; c) Resume only work activities, restoring the initial layer probability; or d) Increase isolation by halting all remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

The model presents two scenarios - mitigation and suppression strategies, each with different approaches to slowing down the spread of the epidemic. The suppression strategy shows lower mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths), fewer restrictions (72 vs 111 RDI), and reduced health care intensity compared to the mitigation strategy. The model also explored additional scenarios including maintaining strict restrictions to suppress the epidemic by the end of 2020, and scenarios with mild restrictions or relaxation leading to a rapid increase in cases.

A high reproduction number indicates a potentially serious epidemic that may require swift public health interventions, particularly during peak social contact times.

With the distribution of the serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change\n\nIntroduction \nGlobal coupled climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012) have struggled to reproduce key Southern Ocean climate trends observed, such as surface cooling, surface freshening, and sea ice expansion (Turner et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2016; Kostov et al. 2018). The increase in Antarctic meltwater anomaly over time may have influenced these trends (Rye et al. 2020). Climate models typically ignore the anomalous freshwater flux resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been on the rise in recent decades, reaching approximately 500 Gt yr. Recent studies suggest that incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help reconcile the disparities between observations and simulations (Bintanja et al. 2013; Rye et al. 2014; Bintanja et al. 2015; Rye et al. 2020).

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

The gap between the total predicted infections and confirmed infections in Hubei is significant, mainly due to the adoption of clinical diagnosis as an additional criterion by the local medical agency after Feb 12.

A set of ODE equations is used to model the dynamics of an infectious disease and the control by artificial factors (Eq.1). Within the model, individuals infected (U) can directly transition to confirmed infections (C) or indirectly through quarantine (Q). By simplifying the model, we can eliminate the direct pathway and represent it as Eq. 2. Biologically meaningful parameters, such as the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation (T) and the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation (w), can be defined from the SUQC model. The reproductive number of the infection (R) is calculated as \u03b1=1=g1. Parameter inference is essential for model fitting and estimating parameters. Cumulative confirmed infections (C\u00f0t\u00de) are typically used for model fitting, with initial values of susceptible individuals (S\u00f00\u00de) approximating the population size and initial confirmed infections (C\u00f00\u00de) obtained from official reports.

Fortunately, in the SUQC model, an exact value for \u03b1 is not crucial, as the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1 is sensitive to parameter optimization, allowing the bias of \u03b1 to be balanced by g1. Additional parameters and initial values, such as g1, \u03b2, U(0), and Q(0), are determined by fitting the daily confirmed infection data to the model. The expected daily confirmed infection data provided by the model is denoted as ^C, and the loss function is optimized using the interior-point method in MATLAB to infer parameter values. Different initial values are tested in parameter optimization, and it is observed that the inferred parameter values are not highly sensitive to the provided initial values. It is important to note that the loss function may overweight later observations due to higher cumulative case numbers, prompting the exploration of weighted loss functions to better incorporate information across the entirety of the epidemic.", "original": "da36c1f3037e4009701d4b09b0a6c11a"}

COVID-19 Contagion Spread COVID-19 is highly contagious. As stated in Report 3 from Imperial College London, \"on average, each case infects 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5\u20133.5) other people up to January 18, 2020\" [58]. In each simulation following the SEIR model, there is an initial percentage of infected and immune individuals (\u03b2 9 and \u03b2 10, respectively), while the rest of the population is susceptible. A Dead status is also included, as some individuals perish due to the disease and its complications [59]. Contagion occurs through interaction by proximity or contact among agents. Therefore, higher mobility increases the likelihood of encountering an infected individual and becoming infected. Each simulation considers a contagion distance threshold \u03b2 1, which is the minimum distance required for viral transmission to occur between two agents, and a probability of contagion \u03b2 2 upon contact. The model for the medical condition progression of infected agents is based on [60,61].Once an agent is infected, it can be in one of these sub-states: a) asymptomatic, which includes mild symptoms without hospitalization, b) hospitalization and c) severe, used in cases of hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU).

However, the lack of data poses a greater challenge for modellers. Understanding how confirmed cases correspond to model predictions is a key factor in explaining the variability in predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been tested and diagnosed with COVID-19. In transmission models, the infected compartment encompasses all infected individuals, including those with and without symptoms, hospital contacts, confirmed cases, and misdiagnosed individuals. Confirmed cases represent only a portion of the total infected population predicted by the model. The disparity between data and predictions is likened to an iceberg, where the entire iceberg represents the total infected population, the visible tip represents case data, and the submerged portion symbolizes the undetected infected individuals - the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

During model calibration, it is essential to adjust the model output by discounting the total number of infectious individuals, I\u00f0t\u00de, based on the case-infection ratio r in order to accurately predict confirmed case data and estimate key model parameters like the transmission rate b. Different values of r can lead to a wide range of estimates for b, impacting the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, and the peak time. With the varying case-infection ratio for COVID-19, there is a wide range of possible transmission rates b and therefore a wide range of model predictions. This variability in parameter values interacting with confirmed-case data can result in nonidentifiability, where different parameter combinations can yield similar fits to the data but drastically different epidemic predictions. How nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process significantly impacts the reliability of the model's predictions. Traditional nonlinear least squares methods may struggle with detecting or addressing nonidentifiability, as they rely on basic optimization algorithms that may not be able to differentiate between multiple global minima of the objective function.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}
