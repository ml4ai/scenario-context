Using data on Argentinian family sizes from 2009, probabilities are assigned to families with sizes ranging from 1 to 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

The researchers assume an optimistic scenario where individuals are aware of the virus from the start, leading to an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1.This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic.

The research began by analyzing a social network with its original infection probabilities. The infection originated at a node with a degree closest to the network average and spread daily over a period of 300 days. The study focused on an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1. This initial value of \u03b2 was found to better reflect the Argentine pandemic situation. After 27 days, a moderate quarantine was introduced to replicate measures taken by most Argentine states on March 24. This quarantine involved reducing contacts in certain layers of the social network, such as religious activities and schools, to 30% of their initial values (\u03b2 = 0.09). Essential services and activities necessitating higher precautionary measures continued despite the quarantine. The study then analyzed how the \u03b2 parameter influenced the overall epidemic pattern, revealing that higher infection rates led to faster disease spread but also quicker resolution due to natural immunization among recovered individuals.4.1.

The noticeable difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the past ten days could be attributed to the higher number of tests being conducted in Argentina. Alternatively, it may be linked to the consistent decrease in isolation levels in the country, which have been below 50% for most days in the past month. A fixed isolation level similar to the one observed in the initial days after government decrees in Argentina was considered here, although data from the same source indicate that these levels are continuously fluctuating. Consequently, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the upcoming simulation could potentially exceed those reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). In terms of the daily death toll, the average number predicted by the models proposed is higher than the official figures, which is somewhat anticipated due to potentially higher underdetection rates alongside fewer tests being administered. To further explore this, we examined the number of deaths in Argentina from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases from 2019 and 2020, with the findings presented in Fig. 5. A distinct upward trend is observable after February 26, the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Argentina, suggesting that the actual death toll could be considerably higher than reported. \n\nMoving forward, after the initial epidemic phase, we consider four potential actions that could be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) Maintaining current isolation levels without any additional measures; b) Ending isolation and resuming activities to normal (initial network layers and weights); c) Only reintroducing work activities while restoring the initial layer probabilities; or d) Increasing isolation by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

The use of a multivariate normal distribution as a prior was necessary for modeling and tractability reasons, as a unimodal prior with ellipsoidal contours was required for the subsequent analysis. Random sets of parameters were then drawn from this Bayesian prior, taking into account the constraints of positive and/or bounded values, to form a prior distribution over infections considering parameter uncertainty. Testing twice a week was found to be effective in controlling infections in most cases, but large outbreaks could occur under certain parameter settings. To explore the impact of interventions on robustness to parameter uncertainty, a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with different levels of pessimism regarding infection numbers was developed.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

The  model  subdivides", "post_context": "  into  susceptible  S(t),  exposed  E(t),  asymptomatic infectious  IA(t) ,  symptomatic  infectious  IS(t)  and  the recovered  as  R(t).The presence of the pathogen in the environment is labeled as P(t). Therefore, for the human population, the equation N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t) holds true. Research has suggested that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) infected individuals can spread the virus to susceptible individuals S(t) they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals sneeze or cough without taking necessary precautions, the virus can spread to the surrounding environment. Given that the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for extended periods, individuals in close proximity to these environments are more likely to be exposed to the virus, particularly in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak before proper hygiene measures are put in place. In the transmission of the disease, susceptible individuals first transition to the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period of the host. The exposed individuals then move on to either the asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious populations. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interaction at time t. Most infected individuals recover and transition to the recovered human population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and the pathogens in the environment can be seen in Figure 1. The parameters utilized in the COVID-19 transmission model are detailed in Table 1. This model results in a six-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations as shown in Figure 1 depicting the SEIR-P model of COVID-19 transmission.", "original": "3a10066fb61f464b3fccbb314e8488b9"}

In this model, the constants \u03b11 and \u03b12 represent the frequency at which individuals acquire COVID-19 from the environment and from infected individuals, respectively. Figure 2 illustrates that with \u03b11 = 0.05, there is a higher risk of infection from a contaminated environment compared to an infected individual, leading to an increase in exposed, asymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Conversely, with \u03b12 = 0.05, the chances of infection from an individual are higher than from a contaminated environment. Additionally, in Figure 2c, the number of susceptible individuals decreases by the 23rd day for \u03b12 = 0.05, indicating a rapid spread of infection. See Figures 2d\u2013f for the progression of infection within the first 20 days.Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for \u03b12 = 0.05 , as compared to when \u03b11 = 0.05 and \u03b12 = 0.1.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Similar to the simple SIR model, shielding alone has the potential to reduce the epidemic burden by lowering both the overall impact and shortening the peak event. In a population of 10,000,000 for a high-transmission scenario, the final epidemic predictions show 71,000 deaths in the baseline case, 58,000 deaths with intermediate shielding, and 20,000 deaths with enhanced shielding. For a low-transmission scenario in the same population size, the final epidemic predictions are 50,000 deaths in the baseline case, 34,000 deaths with intermediate shielding, and 8,300 deaths with enhanced shielding. Despite lower proportions, most deaths occur in individuals aged 60 and older, which aligns with previous COVID-19 models and outbreaks in Italy and Japan. While our simulations focus on shielding effects alone, ongoing measures like social distancing can further reduce interaction rates. The effectiveness of shielding depends on the identification and substitutability of potential shields, with benefits potentially higher in populations with a skewed demographic distribution. Factors such as demographic makeup, asymptomatic transmission, and immunity duration all play a role in the population-scale effects of shielding.", "original": "e195534dc5936158ea4196bb28d156c8"}

However, after January 30, all regions exhibited an R value below 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures effectively curbed the spread of COVID-19.The confirmation rate of Ningbo estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Zhejiang excluding Ningbo (0.1914), and that of China excluding Zhejiang (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Ningbo on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Ningbo and Zhejiang is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Zhejiang, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities.

To model the dynamics of infectious diseases and artificial control factors, a set of ODE equations was established (Eq.1). In this model, infected individuals either go directly to being confirmed or indirectly through quarantine. The direct route can be seen as a special case of the latter with no delay time in quarantine. Therefore, the model was simplified by removing the direct path as shown in Eq. 2. Parameters such as the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation (T) and the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation (w) can be defined from the SUQC model. The reproductive number of the infection is represented by R=\u03b1=g1. Parameter inference is usually based on the number of cumulative confirmed infections, C(t), as it is the only variable with daily observed data for model fitting. The initial susceptible individuals (S(0)) is assumed to be equal to the population size, while the initial confirmed infections (C(0)) is obtained from official reports.Note that the initial time of the ODE system does not have to be at the beginning of the epidemic, and can start from any time point during the break of COVID-19.

Fortunately, in our model, an exact value of \u03b1 is not crucial as the overall infection rate, measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1, is sensitive to parameter optimization and can help balance any bias in \u03b1. By fitting the daily confirmed infection data to the model, we determine the values of free parameters such as g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de, and Q\u00f00\u00de. The model provides an expected daily time series of confirmed infections denoted as ^C=f \u00f0g1,\u03b2,U0,Q0\u00de, which is calculated using a numerical method. We then optimize a loss function with the interiorpoint method in MATLAB to infer the parameter values. We find that our results are not significantly influenced by the initial values chosen for parameter optimization. It is important to note that the loss function may give undue importance to later data points due to the cumulative nature of case numbers, leading us to explore alternative weighted loss functions for a more comprehensive analysis of the epidemic progression.", "original": "da36c1f3037e4009701d4b09b0a6c11a"}

The likelihood of contagion increases with proximity and contact between individuals. The model includes a contagion distance threshold and a probability of transmission upon contact. The progression of the infection among individuals follows a specific model based on medical research.Once an agent is infected, it can be in one of these sub-states: a) asymptomatic, which includes mild symptoms without hospitalization, b) hospitalization and c) severe, used in cases of hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU).

Despite this, the lack of data presents a more significant challenge for modellers. A key factor that contributes to variations in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) aligns with those predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical attention, underwent testing, and received a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 through DNA or imaging tests. In transmission models, the infected compartment encompasses all individuals who are infected, including those who show symptoms, those who do not, those with confirmed lab tests, and those who are misdiagnosed. Consequently, confirmed cases (data) only represent a portion of the total infected population (model predictions). The analogy of an iceberg best illustrates the distinction between data and model predictions: the entire iceberg signifies the complete infected population, with only the tip above the surface representing the reported cases. The submerged part of the iceberg symbolizes the infected individuals who evade public health surveillance and testing - often referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021).\n\nWhy could this pose a problem for modelers? In model calibration, it is necessary to adjust the total number of infectious individuals predicted by the model by a case-infection ratio in order to accurately estimate key parameters such as the transmission rate. This process helps to predict confirmed case data and determine important factors such as the basic reproduction number and peak time of an epidemic. The wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio of COVID-19 results in a wide range of estimated transmission rates, leading to a variety of reported model predictions. This nonidentifiability issue, where different combinations of parameters can produce similar fits to the data but lead to significantly different predictions, is a common challenge in modeling. The way in which this issue is addressed during model calibration can greatly impact the reliability of predictions. Standard methods like nonlinear least squares may struggle to handle nonidentifiability due to their basic optimization algorithms. These algorithms aim to find the best fit for the data but may struggle to distinguish between the many possible global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

The transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual, with a probability denoted as \u03b2.
