Our analysis is based on a fixed isolation level similar to the early days after government decrees in Colombia, although data indicates that these levels are fluctuating. Consequently, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the remaining simulation could be higher than reported in this paper (refer to the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the subsequent section). Regarding daily death toll, the average number of deaths projected by the model surpasses the official statistics, possibly due to higher underdetection rates with fewer tests being conducted.

Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs", "post_context": ").Additionally, three alternative scenarios were analyzed. One scenario involved the continuous enforcement of strict mobility restrictions (50%), resulting in the suppression of the epidemic by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, displayed in Figure 4). The other two scenarios examined the impact of initiating mild restrictions from the beginning (25%) or easing restrictions before summer (30%), both of which projected a significant increase in the spread of the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3). Further details can be seen in Figure 2, which depicts a timeline of a mitigation strategy, including the addition of new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and only testing severe cases. At the conclusion of the one-year simulation, there are 660,000 recovered patients. These results reflect a single simulation run, not an average of multiple simulations. Figure 3 also presents a timeline, focusing on a suppression strategy with an initial 50% reduction in mobility and later reductions to 20-25%, combined with aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing. At the end of the one-year simulation, there are 77,000 recovered patients. These results also represent a single simulation run. (Tuomisto et al.

Achieving this high threshold rate of quarantine requires a strong public health infrastructure and strict adherence to personal protective and public health measures, including reducing effective contacts, separation, and restrictions during quarantine.

The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

The peak in active infections is anticipated to occur at the end of 2021, followed by an even higher peak in the spring, driven by the wild-type and Alpha variants. The Alpha-driven wave is expected to subside as vaccination efforts intensify. The proportion of asymptomatic infections is projected to be approximately equal to that of symptomatic cases, primarily affecting the unvaccinated population. Additionally, the number of individuals who have recovered from the virus is estimated to reach 7% of the population by the end of 2021.

The initial contact rate c0 has been set at 14.781, based on the average rate between January 10th, 2020 and January 22nd, 2020. Similarly, dI0 has been assumed to be 0.133. The initial conditions were determined by solving our previous model from January 10th, 2020 to January 23rd, 2020. The main objective is to estimate the parameter values q, cb, r1, dIf, and r2. We utilized the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm for fitting the model to the data. The algorithm ran for 70,000 iterations with a burn-in of the first 50,000 iterations, and the Geweke convergence diagnostic method was used to assess convergence of the chains. The results of the estimation are presented in Table 1.

With the strongest prevention and control measures in place in China, the previously estimated basic reproduction number may not accurately reflect the future epidemic trend. Therefore, we use the updated data to parameterize the proposed model (Tang et al., 2020) and re-estimate the 2019-nCov transmission risk.

Keywords: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change.\n\nIntroduction\nOne of the shortcomings of global coupled climate models in the CMIP5 project is their inability to accurately recreate observed trends in the Southern Ocean, such as surface cooling, freshening, and sea ice expansion. The increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly may have contributed to these trends. While climate models typically overlook the freshwater flux from Antarctic ice sheet mass loss, recent research indicates that incorporating the meltwater anomaly could help align observations with simulations. Incorporating Antarctic glacial meltwater could have a substantial impact.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

Therefore, for the human population, the equation N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t) holds true. Research has shown that COVID-19 can spread in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic (IA(t)) and symptomatic (IS(t)) infected individuals can transmit the virus to susceptible individuals (S(t)) they come in close contact with. Furthermore, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, the virus can spread to their surrounding environment, where it can survive for some time. This increases the risk of exposure for susceptible individuals in close contact with the environment, particularly in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. The disease spreads as susceptible individuals transition to the exposed population (E(t)) due to the incubation period. The exposed individuals then move to either asymptomatic (IA(t)) or symptomatic (IS(t)) infectious populations. P(t) represents the number of pathogens present during human interactions at time t. Most infectious individuals recover and join the recovered population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between humans and pathogens in the environment is depicted in Fig. 1.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Our core shielding model forms the basis for our application to COVID-19, highlighting the conservative benefits of shielding. Further variations of this model can be explored through detailed mixing and substitution models, including spatially explicit domains or network analysis. In this study, we apply our shield immunity model to the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on a population of susceptible, exposed, and infectious individuals, with a subset needing hospital care. Our assumptions are based on age-stratified risk data from previous studies, modeling potential outcomes in the UK and US.

It was found that more stringent policies, such as the stay-at-home order, were implemented later but were associated with larger decreases in the residual infection rate.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects.

The age distribution of A 1 agents is determined by the parameter \u03b1 4, such as A 1 age following a beta distribution \u03b2(2, 5) as described in [56]. The social stratum of A 1, A 2, and A 3 agents is represented by the income distribution \u03b3 1, defined in Table 4, which corresponds to a portion of the wealth indicated by the GDP parameter \u03b3 3. The total wealth represented by \u03b3 3 is distributed among agents based on public, business, and personal percentages determined by \u03b3 5, \u03b3 4, and \u03b3 6. Once all agents are created, the simulation model begins its iteration loop, representing the passage of time, as explained in the next section. Each iteration in the simulation represents one hour during which agents carry out actions based on their type and behaviors. A 1 agents, as shown in Fig. 1 and detailed in section 3.3.1, may come into proximity with other A 1, A 2, or A 3 agents during their movement. The possibility of contagion between two A 1 agents through contact is discussed in section 3.3.2. Economic relationships between agents, such as commercial transactions between A 1 and A 3 agents, tax payments to the government by A 4 agents, labor relationships between A 3 and A 1 agents, and housing expenses between A 2 and A 1 agents, are presented in section 3.3.3.

This variance may be influenced by the mean. However, the lack of sufficient data poses a more significant challenge for modelers. A crucial factor contributing to the variability in model predictions is the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical attention, underwent testing, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed through DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all infected individuals, including those with or without symptoms, individuals in contact with healthcare facilities, those with confirmed test results, and those who may have been misdiagnosed. Notably, confirmed cases represent only a fraction of the total infected population predicted by the model. An iceberg serves as an apt metaphor to illustrate this disparity between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, with the visible tip above the water surface representing the confirmed cases. Conversely, the submerged portion of the iceberg denotes the infected individuals not captured by public health surveillance and testing, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

When calibrating a model to estimate key parameters like transmission rate b by fitting model output to confirmed cases data, it is crucial to adjust for the total number of infectious individuals, I\u00f0t\u00de, by the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed case data. Different values of r lead to various estimates for the transmission rate b, which then determines the basic reproduction number R 0, epidemic scale, and peak time. The wide range of potential case-infection ratios for COVID-19 results in a wide range of estimated transmission rates, leading to diverse model predictions. This nonidentifiability, where multiple parameter combinations can fit the data well but lead to varying predictions, is a challenge in model calibration. The method used to address nonidentifiability significantly impacts the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method may not effectively address this issue due to its basic optimization algorithm, which struggles to find a unique global minimum for the objective function.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Figures 1 shows the transfer diagrams for both models, with details of all model parameters provided in Tables 1 and 2. Both models assume that deaths in the S, E, and I compartments are negligible within the model's prediction period. Since we calibrate the models using newly confirmed case data, the death term in the R compartment does not impact our model fitting. The differential equations for each model are as follows:\n\nS' = \u03b2IS, I' = \u03b2IS - (r + m)I, R' = rI, S' = \u03b2IS, E' = \u03b2IS - \u03b5E, I' = \u03b5E - (r + m)I, R' = rI.

It is common to use a Poisson or negative binomial probability model for observed count data. When the mean of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is large, it approximates a normal distribution. Since the newly confirmed cases are approaching large values quickly, the distribution of the count data will be approximately normal and the probability model for the observed count data in our study was assumed to a normal distribution with mean given by rI and variance given by 1= t.

The duration of symptoms and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients can vary greatly, with durations typically increasing with severity. Our model reflects this variability by assigning different recovery times for asymptomatic, mild, and severe cases. Critical cases may recover or lead to death, with the likelihood of death increasing with age. The transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual comes into contact with an infectious individual, with a probability denoted as \u03b2. In a well-mixed population with an average of 20 contacts per day, a \u03b2 value of 0.016 leads to a doubling time of 4-6 days and an R0 of 2.2-2.7. The specific value of \u03b2 = 0.016 in Covasim was chosen based on data from Washington and Oregon states.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8.

Interventions like physical distancing can alter the value of \u03b2.

Non-critical cases are assumed to recover, while critical cases have the possibility of either recovering or dying, with the likelihood of death increasing with age (Table 2). Transmission of the virus occurs with a probability \u03b2 whenever a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual. In a well-mixed population with an average of 20 contacts per day, a value of \u03b2 = 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of 4-6 days and an R0 of approximately 2.2-2.7, depending on factors like population size and age structure.

Interventions, such as physical distancing, can also modify the value of \u03b2. Additionally, we account for variations in individual infectiousness by modeling differences in viral load.Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The distribution of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary by location, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmission is reduced if the infectious individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted as needed depending on the specific modeling scenario or context. It is worth noting that some studies have observed much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
