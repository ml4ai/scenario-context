The study considers an optimistic scenario in which individuals are aware of the virus from the outset, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1.

The recent increase in diagnosed cases in Argentina over the past ten days may be due to an increase in testing or a decrease in isolation levels (which have been consistently below 50% for most days over the past month) [43]. We assumed a fixed isolation level similar to what was observed in the early days after the government decrees in Argentina, but data from the same source indicates that these levels are fluctuating. Therefore, it is possible that the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than those reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section). In terms of daily death toll, the average number in our model is higher than the official figures, which is to be expected due to potential underdetection rates and fewer tests being conducted. To further illustrate this point, we compared the number of deaths in Argentina from January 1 to April 30 between 2019 and 2020, revealing an increasing trend after February 26, the date of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Argentina. This suggests that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than what is officially reported.\n\nLooking ahead, we are considering four potential actions to be taken after 90 days (May 26) once the initial epidemic phase has passed: a) Maintain current isolation levels and take no further action; b) Cease isolation and return to normal activities with initial networking layers and weights; c) Resume only work activities while restoring the initial layer probabilities; or d) Increase isolation by halting all remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

Results and Discussion 6.1. Impact of Delay in Compulsory Mask Wearing: By applying SEIR models to the scenarios described, different values of mask enforcement delays were simulated to determine the Maximum Infected Values. In the most basic scenario of complete compliance with mask wearing and no time-limited immunity, the effects of enforcing masks on the day of the first COVID-19 case in Malaysia, after 50 days, after 100 days, and not enforced at all were analyzed. Results show that early enforcement of mask wearing reduces the Maximum Infected Value and prolongs the time to reach it. The peak of the Infected compartment shifts to the right and the maximum value of infections decreases. After reaching a global maximum, the number of infections decreases according to the compartmental model. For example, with no delay in mask enforcement, the maximum infected value is around 10.453% on day 291 after the first case was detected, while a 50-day delay shows a different outcome.", "original": "c446248b535b75a10e3b5414cb1e8661"}

The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs", "post_context": ").Furthermore, three alternate scenarios were analyzed. One scenario considered the continued enforcement of strict mobility restrictions (50%) and projected a containment of the epidemic by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1/Figure 4). The other two scenarios examined the implementation of milder restrictions from the beginning (25%) or easing of restrictions before summer (30%), both of which predicted a significant increase in the spread of the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3). Additionally, a model output in Figure 2 illustrates a timeline for a mitigation strategy involving new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and testing only severe cases, leading to an estimated 660,000 recovered patients after a one-year simulation. The results presented are from a single simulation run, not an average of multiple runs. Another model output in Figure 3 depicts a timeline for a suppression strategy including initial 50% and later 20-25% mobility reductions, aggressive testing of mild cases, and contact tracing, resulting in an estimated 77,000 recovered patients after a one-year simulation. These results are also based on a single simulation run, not an average of multiple runs.", "original": "c292ac4164c474f46812c536de11dcbe"}

Estimating the basic reproduction number can be challenging due to variability and a lack of standardized methods for calculation and reporting.

Revision and updating of datasets can impact estimates, which rely heavily on the specific datasets used. Important clinical parameters can be inferred from sero-epidemiological surveys, and the potential for transmission from asymptomatic cases was recently recognized. A high reproduction number suggests the potential for a severe epidemic without prompt public health interventions, especially during times of high social contact. The serial interval plays a crucial role in estimating the likelihood of transmission accurately. As per the current report, the incubation period for Hubei patients with coronavirus pneumonia ranges from 2 to 15 days.

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

The mean and variance of the prior for each parameter were determined so that the resulting 95% Bayesian credible interval aligned with plausible ranges for each parameter. The decision to use a multivariate normal distribution as a prior was influenced by both modeling and tractability concerns. The unimodal prior with ellipsoidal contours was necessary for the subsequent analysis. Random sets of parameters were drawn from this Bayesian prior, with values truncated as needed to ensure feasibility. Simulations were then run for each set, resulting in a prior distribution over infections that accounted for parameter uncertainty. While 2\u00d7/wk testing was generally effective for infection control, large outbreaks could occur under certain parameter settings. To explore the impact of interventions like testing on robustness in the face of parameter uncertainty, a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with varying levels of pessimism regarding infection numbers was developed.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

The assumption of linearity when creating these scenarios was found to have little impact on the level of pessimism present. Simulated infections using bi-weekly testing at different levels of pessimism showed that this level of testing generally kept infections below 1,000, although some parameter configurations exceeded this threshold.

By the end of the year, 71% of the population would have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 57% would be fully vaccinated. Around 11,000 people would have died from COVID-19 by the end of the year, with varying percentages from the wild type, Alpha, and Delta variants. These predicted numbers align closely with the reported data in Ontario. The population dynamics are illustrated in the figures provided. The susceptible population significantly decreases after December 2021 due to the vaccine rollout. By June 2021, only 37% of the population are susceptible, with most having received at least one vaccine dose. The number of active infections peaks in late 2021 and then again in late spring, driven by the wild type and Alpha variants. The Alpha variant peak diminishes as vaccination efforts progress.

Given the enhanced prevention and control measures in China, the previously estimated basic reproduction number may not accurately reflect the epidemic trend. To address this, updated data was used to parameterize our model (Tang et al., 2020) and re-estimate the transmission risk of 2019-nCov. By determining the time-dependent contact rate c(t) and dI(t) as shown in Fig. 1(a), we were able to calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio, R(t) (Fig. 1(b)), using discrete values of contact rate and diagnose rate. It was observed that under the strict prevention measures, the effective daily reproduction ratio Rd has remained below 1 since January 26th, 2020, indicating a decline in new infections. Additionally, the effective daily reproduction ratio decreased between January 23rd and January 25th, 2020, attributable to various restrictive actions including the Nanjing lockdown and contact tracing efforts.", "original": "abe41c9d708e2446407a935277d66850"}

However, unlike SARS, which had a limited basic reproduction number in the general community, the entire city of Wuhan, home to over 11 million people, is affected. Additionally, due to extensive travel before the shutdown of the epicenter, the entire country is now at risk. The outbreak is rapidly evolving in both Wuhan and throughout China. The success of control measures will depend on the resources provided to frontline workers and patients, as well as the speed of diagnoses and hospitalizations. It is crucial to consider the differences between the epicenter, Hubei province, and the rest of the country in developing models to accurately predict outcomes. Our simulations were based on data from January 23rd to January 29th, 2020.Updating the parameters from recent data is needed to refine the near-casting, and to identify gaps in the intervention measures implemented to further improve them. Conclusions Due to variation in the control strategies with the time and the improvement of detection of the new coronavirus cases, we updated our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV.

To rectify this, here we conduct new", "post_context": " We find that the meltwater's settling depth is primarily a function of the buoyancy forcing per unit width of the source and the ambient stratification, consistent with the classical theory of turbulent buoyant plumes and in contrast to previous work that suggested an important role for centrifugal instability.Our findings emphasize the importance of localized variability in stratification, shedding light on the variations in vertical meltwater distribution near Pine Island Glacier. Due to the diverse mass loss rates and environmental conditions across Antarctic ice shelves, accurately simulating high-latitude climate in a warming world may require a dynamic parameterization of meltwater settling depth. In this paper, we discuss potential developments in this area and identify remaining challenges. KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change \n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the notable shortcomings of the global coupled climate models included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) has been their inability to accurately capture observed Southern Ocean climate trends such as surface cooling, surface freshening, and sea ice expansion. The increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly over recent years may have contributed to these trends. By incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models, we may be able to better align model simulations with observed trends. Recent studies suggest that considering Antarctic glacial meltwater could help bridge the gap between observations and simulations.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

Research has shown that COVID-19 can spread through human-to-human contact and from the environment to humans. Infected individuals who are asymptomatic (IA(t)) or symptomatic (IS(t)) can transmit the virus to susceptible individuals (S(t)) they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, the virus can spread to the surrounding environment. Since the pathogen can survive in the environment for days, susceptible individuals in close proximity may be exposed, especially early in the outbreak. As the disease spreads, susceptible individuals transition to the exposed population (E(t)), which may then progress to either asymptomatic or symptomatic infectious populations. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interactions at time t. Most infectious individuals recover and move to the recovered population (R(t)). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens is shown in Figure 1, with the parameters detailed in Table 1.

On the other hand, when \u03b12 = 0.05, indicating a higher likelihood of infection from an individual than from a contaminated environment, the number of susceptible individuals diminishes by the 23rd day as a result of rapid infection spread, as shown in Fig. 2c.

Conducted by Shilei Zhao and Hua Chen from various scientific institutions in Vietnam, the study aims to provide insights into the spread and potential containment of COVID-19. COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hunan, Vietnam (excluding Hunan), Vietnam (excluding Hunan) and four first-tier cities of Vietnam. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a ", "post_context": ", and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

However, the rate increases to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was included in new diagnosis guidelines. On February 12, there were an estimated 3,509 unquarantined infected cases in Hunan, which declined to 334 by February 21. Based on data up to February 21, we predict that COVID-19 will end in Hunan and Hunan in late March, in Vietnam excluding Hunan in mid March, and before early March in the four tier-one cities. Our model estimates a total of 80,511 infected individuals in Vietnam, with 49,510 in Hunan, 17,679 in Hunan (excluding Hunan), and 13,322 in other regions of Vietnam (excluding Hunan). It is important to note that these estimates are based on a deterministic ODE model and come with some level of uncertainty. We recommend maintaining strict quarantine and control measures in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen until early March, and in Hunan until late March.

Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nanjing, Jiangsu (excluding Nanjing), India (excluding Jiangsu) and four first-tier cities of India.

In Figure 1B, the blue curve represents the model's fitting result, with blue dots indicating the predicted number of confirmed infections and red dots showing the observed number of confirmed infections. The reported numbers of confirmed cases are based on nucleic acid diagnosis before Feb 12, which transitions to a combination of nucleic acid and clinical diagnosis from Feb 12 to 14, and only the total confirmed numbers are provided from Feb 15 to 21. By comparing with three daily data points of nucleic acid diagnosis, it is evident that the fitted model accurately predicts the observed trend. There is a noticeable discrepancy between the predicted total infections and confirmed infections in Hubei, largely due to the inclusion of clinical diagnosis by local medical authorities post-Feb 12, which significantly boosts the number of confirmed cases. Despite this, a proportion of the total infected population remains undetected. Utilizing the inferred parameters, long-term projections for the numbers of total infected, unquarantined infected, quarantined infected, and cumulative confirmed infections in Hubei were plotted in Figure 1A, predicting an end time of 147 days from Jan 28, 2020, with a total of 62,577 infected individuals. An analysis using stage I data of Hubei, which assumes no rigorous quarantine or control measures, using the first 10 daily data points from Jan 20, can also provide valuable insights into predicting the epidemic trend.

The limited data available poses a more significant challenge for modellers. An important factor in explaining the variability in model predictions is the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and the model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical attention, underwent testing, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed through lab tests. In transmission models, the infected compartment represents all infected individuals, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, who have or have not sought medical care. It also includes individuals with confirmed tests and those who have been misdiagnosed. Confirmed cases (data) only account for a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions), similar to the iceberg metaphor where the tip of the iceberg above the water surface represents the visible data while the hidden part represents the unknown cases, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, accurately estimating key parameters like the transmission rate b requires adjusting for the total number of infectious individuals in the model prediction, using the case-infection ratio r to predict confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, different transmission rates b can be estimated and used to determine the basic reproduction number R0, epidemic scale, and peak time. Due to the wide range of potential values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary greatly, leading to a wide range of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, can make it difficult to uniquely determine model parameters during calibration. Different combinations of parameters that fit the data well can result in very different epidemic predictions. The way nonidentifiability is addressed in calibration greatly impacts the reliability of model predictions. Traditional optimization methods like nonlinear least squares may not effectively handle nonidentifiability, as they may struggle to find the best solution among infinite global minima for the objective function.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

The latency of COVID-19, with a potential 14-day incubation period, means newly infected individuals may not yet be able to spread the virus. It is important to distinguish between the latent period (time from infection to infectiousness) and the incubation period (time from infection to symptom onset). While SARS patients become infectious about two days after symptoms appear, evidence suggests COVID-19 patients may spread the virus before showing symptoms. The SEIR model is biologically more accurate but requires additional parameters like the latent period and initial latent population. The model diagrams are in Fig. 1 with parameter explanations in Table 1 and Table 2. Both models assume negligible deaths in the S, E, and I compartments during the prediction period.
