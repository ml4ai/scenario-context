Impact of Delay in Enforcing Mask Wearing \n\nBy utilizing SEIR models in the scenarios discussed above, we were able to identify the Maximum Infected Values by simulating different delays in enforcing mask wearing. In Scenario 1, with full compliance and no time-limited immunity, the effects of enforcing mask wearing on different timelines were examined. Figures 3 depict the outcomes when mask wearing was enforced (a) immediately after the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Malaysia; (b) after a delay of 50 days; (c) after a delay of 100 days; and (d) not enforced at all. The results show that early enforcement of mask wearing leads to a reduction in the Maximum Infected Value and a longer time to reach this peak. This is evident from the shift in the Infected compartment curve to the right and a lower peak value. The number of infected individuals rises until it reaches the Maximum Infected Value before declining, as predicted by compartmental models. For instance, in the case of (a) no delay in enforcement, the Maximum Infected Value is around 10.453%, with the peak occurring on day 291. With a delay of (b) 50 days, the Maximum Infected Value is approximately 10.479%, with the peak on day \u2060297.", "original": "26443a70221149e9a56c039f7cc8ca2d"}

Results and Discussion Dynamics of Delay of Mandatory Mask Wearing When utilizing the SEIR models for the 3 scenarios outlined in the previous sections, we can determine Maximum Infected Values by simulating different delays in mask enforcement. In Scenario 1, where there is full compliance with mask wearing and no time-limited immunity, Figure 3 illustrates the effects of enforcing mask wearing (a) on the day COVID-19's first case was reported in Malaysia; (b) after a 50-day delay; (c) after a 100-day delay; and (d) not enforcing it at all. The graph shows that earlier enforcement of mask wearing not only decreases the Maximum Infected Value, but also extends the time taken to reach this peak. This can be seen by a shift to the right of the peak of the Infected compartment and a lower peak value of the infected curve. The number of infected individuals rises until it reaches a global peak, before decreasing as expected in this type of model. This peak is known as the Maximum Infected Value. In case (a) with no delay in mask enforcement, the peak infected value is around 10.453%, occurring on day 291 post the first case. In case (b) with a 50-day delay, the peak infected value is roughly 10.479%, happening on day 195.

We confirmed the linearity assumption used in creating these scenarios by comparing the median number of infections under various levels of pessimism. Simulated infections using bi-weekly testing at different levels of pessimism showed that while most parameter configurations kept infections below 1,000, some reached higher levels that grew rapidly with increasing pessimism. Additional testing was shown to reduce this risk, with infections remaining low even at high levels of pessimism. The data and scenarios presented in public reports and Cornell Faculty Senate meetings included both nominal and pessimistic scenarios similar to those described here.", "original": "44a9183827b35a359151860f8f0f665b"}

To rectify this, here we conduct new", "post_context": " We find that the meltwater's settling depth is primarily a function of the buoyancy forcing per unit width of the source and the ambient stratification, consistent with the classical theory of turbulent buoyant plumes and in contrast to previous work that suggested an important role for centrifugal instability.Our findings underscore the important role of localized variability in stratification in explaining the fluctuating distribution of vertical meltwater near Pine Island Glacier. Given the diverse mass loss rates and environmental conditions across Antarctic ice shelves, accurately simulating high-latitude climate in a warming world may require a dynamic parameterization of meltwater settling depth. In this study, we discuss how such parameterization could be developed and address the remaining challenges. KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change 1. Introduction \nMany global coupled climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012) have struggled to accurately reproduce observed Southern Ocean climate trends such as surface cooling, freshening, and sea ice expansion (Turner et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2016; Kostov et al. 2018). The increasing Antarctic meltwater anomaly in recent years may have influenced these trends (Rye et al. 2020). Current climate models often neglect the anomalous freshwater flux resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been rising to around 500 Gt yr over the past few decades (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019). Studies suggest that incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could bridge the gap between observations and simulations, potentially explaining the observed trends (Bintanja et al. 2013; Rye et al. 2014; Bintanja et al. 2015; Rye et al. 2020). The inclusion of Antarctic glacial meltwater could have significant implications.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

Therefore, for the human population, the equation N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t) holds true. Research has indicated that the COVID-19 virus can be spread in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic individuals (IA(t)) and symptomatic individuals (IS(t)) infected with the virus can transmit it to susceptible individuals (S(t)) they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without taking necessary precautions, the virus can spread to the environment. Since the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for some days, individuals in close proximity to these environments, especially in the early stages of the outbreak, are at risk of exposure before hygiene protocols are established. \n\nDuring the spread of the disease, susceptible individuals transition to the exposed population (E(t)) due to the incubation period of the host. The exposed individuals then move to either the asymptomatic (IA(t)) or symptomatic (IS(t)) infectious population. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interactions at time t. The majority of infectious individuals recover and become part of the recovered human population (R(t)). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is shown in Figure 1. The parameters used in the COVID-19 transmission model are listed in Table 1. The model results in a six-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations.

By the 23rd day, in Figure 2c, the number of susceptible individuals diminishes for \u03b12 = 0.05 as a result of rapid infections, as shown in Figures 2d-f for the first 20 days.Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for \u03b12 = 0.05 , as compared to when \u03b11 = 0.05 and \u03b12 = 0.1. Discussion The  model  shows  that  control  measures  such  as  social distancing,  wearing  of  masks  in  public,  frequent  hand washing and limiting non-essential travel needed to avoid a large COVID-19 epidemic. There is a growing concern that  this  disease  could  continue  to  ravage  the  human population globally since many aspects of the COVID-19 are yet to be discovered, which also poses a challenge to the long-term mathematical modeling of the disease.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Implementing large-scale serological testing initiatives is crucial for proactive measures to end the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate economic recovery, aiming to limit the final outbreak to less than 25% of the population infected, compared to an estimated 90% without protective measures. Our core shielding model serves as the foundation for application to COVID-19, capturing the conservative benefits of shielding, with potential variations in detailed mixing and substitution models for spatially explicit domains or networks. In this context, we apply our shield immunity model to the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on a population of susceptible, exposed, and infectious individuals, along with recovered individuals in a 'business as usual' scenario. We consider different categories of symptomatic cases, including those requiring hospital care, with subacute and critical cases, the latter necessitating intensive care unit intervention. We account for age-stratified risk factors based on previous studies in the United Kingdom and the United States, incorporating shield immunity into our model to analyze potential outcomes.

Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hunan, Japan (excluding Hunan), Japan (excluding Hunan) and four first-tier cities of Japan. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Tokyo had areproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a ", "post_context": ", indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.Our model estimates that the confirmation rate of COVID-19 in Hunan is 0.0643, lower than Hunan excluding Wuhan (0.1914) and Japan excluding Hunan (0.2189). However, after February 12 when clinical evidence was incorporated into new diagnosis guidelines, the rate jumps to 0.3229. On February 12, there were approximately 3,509 unquarantined infected cases in Hunan, decreasing to 334 by February 21. Based on data up to February 21, we predict that COVID-19 in Hunan and Hunan may end in late March, mid-March for Japan excluding Hunan, and before early March for tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in Japan, with 49,510 from Hunan, 17,679 from Hunan (excluding Wuhan), and the rest from other regions. The model suggests maintaining strict quarantine and control measures until early March in tier-one cities and late March in Hunan.

From February 15 to 21, only the total confirmed numbers from both types of diagnoses were reported.

The model predicts a significant difference between total infections and confirmed infections in Shanghai due to the adoption of clinical diagnosis after February 12. Despite this, a proportion of the total infected individuals remain unidentified even with clinical diagnosis.

Despite this, a portion of total infected individuals remain unidentified. Long-term projections for total infected individuals (I), unquarantined infected (U), quarantined infected (Q), and cumulative confirmed cases (C) in Wuhan are illustrated in Fig. 1A. The end time is estimated to be 147 days from Jan 28, 2020, with a total of 62,577 infected individuals. Analysis using stage I data of Wuhan reveals insights into the epidemic trend without strict quarantine measures.

However, the lack of data is a major concern for modellers. One key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the confirmed cases compare with the model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. The infected compartment in transmission models includes all infected individuals, whether they exhibit symptoms or not, have been tested or not, and even those who have been misdiagnosed. In essence, confirmed cases represent just a fraction of the total infected population predicted by the model. The analogy of an iceberg best illustrates this difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, with the visible part above the water representing the confirmed cases. The submerged part of the iceberg signifies the infected individuals who are not captured by public health surveillance and testing, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021).Why might this pose a challenge for modelers? When calibrating a model to estimate important parameters like the transmission rate b by comparing its output to confirmed cases data, it is essential to adjust the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), in the model prediction using the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed cases. By testing various ratios of r, it is possible to determine the transmission rate b that best fits the data, which then influences the basic reproduction number R 0, epidemic scale, and peak time. Due to the wide range of potential values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary significantly, leading to a wide range of model predictions. This phenomenon, known as nonidentifiability in modeling, indicates that different combinations of r and b may fit the data well but produce different epidemic forecasts. Nonidentifiability poses a challenge during model calibration, as a set of parameters cannot be conclusively determined from the available data. How nonidentifiability is addressed during calibration significantly impacts the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is often inadequate for detecting or addressing nonidentifiability due to its basic optimization algorithm. Such algorithms aim to find a global minimum of the objective function, but there are countless potential minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Evidence suggests that for COVID-19, individuals can be infectious before showing symptoms, but the duration of the latent period remains uncertain.

These values were chosen to reflect relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, based on time-use surveys and studies of infections with known contact types, to ensure a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population. When considering the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, the distribution of transmission events in the absence of interventions is roughly 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can be adjusted through interventions like physical distancing. Additionally, we account for varying levels of disease severity and length of time in each disease state, as well as differences in individual infectiousness, by using individual viral load to model infectivity fluctuations.Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load for each agent is drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean 1.0 and shape", "post_context": ", which was the value most consistent with both international estimates [59,60] and fits to data in Olympia state and Washington.The daily viral load is utilized to adjust the per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an individual on a specific day. Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals with default parameter values can be seen in Fig 2. The distribution of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals may vary depending on the situation, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced if the infected individual shows no symptoms [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we have included a parameter that can be adjusted based on the modeling application or context, acknowledging that some studies suggest significantly lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
