The study simulated the spread of the infection on a social network, starting with the original infection probabilities at each layer. The infection began at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spread over 300 days in daily increments. The researchers considered an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the outset, leading to an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1.This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic.

This infection rate is reasonable given the current scenario where most people are wearing masks and taking precautions to prevent infection. Despite some variation in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days, possibly due to increased testing in Brazil or reduced levels of isolation, the model generally shows a good level of similarity to the real data.

The model demonstrates a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation. The increased difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the past ten days may be due to the rise in testing in Peru. Alternatively, it could be attributed to the consistent decrease in isolation levels in the country, which have been below 50% for most days in the past month. Our analysis assumed a fixed isolation level similar to what was observed in the initial days following government decrees in Peru. However, data from the same source indicate that these levels are continuously fluctuating. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may exceed those reported in this paper, as seen in the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section.\n\nIn terms of daily death toll, the average number in our models is higher than official figures, which is expected given potential underdetection rates due to fewer tests being conducted. To further investigate this, we compared the number of deaths in Peru between January 1 and April 30 for 2019 and 2020, revealing a noticeable increase after February 26, the day of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Peru. This suggests that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported numbers.\n\nLooking ahead, after the initial epidemic phase, we are considering four potential actions to be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) Maintaining current isolation levels without further measures; b) Ending isolation and returning to normal activities with initial network structures and weights; c) Resuming only work activities with initial layer probabilities; or d) Increasing isolation by halting remaining activities related to work and transport.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

This high threshold for quarantine places significant demands on the city's public health infrastructure and the adherence of its citizens to personal protective and public health measures. Achieving such a level of quarantine and reduction of transmission-effective contacts requires minimal imported cases from the epicenter, highlighting the importance of travel restrictions.

The increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly over recent years may have played a significant role in driving these trends. Climate models typically overlook the anomalous freshwater flux resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet. Recent studies suggest incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help reconcile the disparities between observations and simulations, potentially explaining the observed trends.

Research indicates that the COVID-19 virus can spread through human-to-human contact and from the environment to humans. Individuals infected with asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) can transmit the virus to susceptible individuals S(t) they come into close contact with. The virus can also spread when infected individuals cough or sneeze without taking necessary precautions, contaminating their surroundings. As the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for several days, susceptible individuals in proximity to these environments are at risk of exposure, particularly at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak before hygiene measures are put in place. The disease spread typically starts with susceptible individuals moving to the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period. The exposed individuals then progress to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) populations. Most infected individuals recover and transition to the recovered population R(t).

A set of ODE equations is used to model the dynamics of an infectious disease and control by artificial factors. In the model, infected individuals can either go directly to being confirmed cases, or indirectly through quarantine. Simplifying the model by removing the direct pathway results in a simplified equation. Parameters such as the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation (T) and the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation (w) can be defined from the model. Additionally, the reproductive number of the infection (R) can be calculated as \u03b1 divided by g1. When inferring parameters from the model, the number of cumulative confirmed infections is typically the only variable with daily data available for fitting the model. The initial values for susceptible individuals (S(0)) and confirmed infections (C(0)) are usually determined based on the population size and official reports of infected individuals.

During this specific time frame, the confirmed number of infected individuals may offer a less biased representation of the natural characteristics of COVID-19.

The parameter \u03b1 is challenging to estimate accurately, with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 based on different methods and data sets. Fortunately, in our model, an exact value of \u03b1 is not crucial as the overall infection ability, represented by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1, is sensitive in parameter optimization. This sensitivity allows for the balancing of any bias in \u03b1 with g1. By fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model, we estimate various free parameters and initial values. The expected daily time series of confirmed infections provided by the model is denoted as ^C=f(g1,\u03b2,U0,Q0) and is calculated using a numerical method. The loss function, err(\u03b1,g1,U0,Q0), is optimized using the interiorpoint method in MATLAB function fmincon to infer the parameter values. Sensitivity tests with different initial values show that the inferred parameter values are not highly dependent on the initial values.

The lack of data poses a more significant challenge for modelers. One reason for the variability in model predictions is understanding the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and model forecasts. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who were tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. The infected compartment in transmission models represents all infected individuals, including those with or without symptoms, those tested, and those who may be misdiagnosed. Confirmed cases are a fraction of the total infected population predicted by the model, with the hidden epidemic representing the unknown infected individuals not captured by public health surveillance and testing, likened to the portion of an iceberg submerged underwater.The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

When calibrating a model, it is crucial to accurately estimate key parameters such as transmission rate by adjusting the model output to match confirmed cases data. This involves adjusting the number of infectious people in the model prediction by a case-infection ratio to effectively predict confirmed cases. Different values of this ratio can lead to varying estimates for the transmission rate, which in turn impacts other aspects of the model like the basic reproduction number and the peak time of the epidemic. The wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19 leads to a wide range of estimated transmission rates, resulting in a diverse set of model predictions. This nonidentifiability issue, where multiple parameter combinations can fit the data well but result in different predictions, poses a challenge in model calibration. The standard nonlinear least squares method often used for calibration struggles to address this issue, as it relies on a basic optimization algorithm that may not identify the best parameter values. Addressing nonidentifiability in the calibration process is crucial for ensuring the reliability of model predictions.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Assumptions in both models include negligible deaths in the S, E, and I compartments during the model prediction period (4 months). Using newly confirmed case data for calibration, the death term in the R compartment does not impact model fitting. The differential equations for each model are listed below: S' = \u03b2IS, I' = \u03b2IS - (r + m)I, R' = rI, S' = \u03b2IS, E' = \u03b2IS - \u03b5E, I' = \u03b5E - (r + m)I, R' = rI.Model calibration from the data For data reliability, the data used for both models (2) and (3) is the newly confirmed cases in Hangzhou city from the official reports from January 20 to February 4, 2020 (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). It is common to use a Poisson or negative binomial probability model for observed count data. When the mean of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is large, it approximates a normal distribution. Since the newly confirmed cases are approaching large values quickly, the distribution of the count data will be approximately normal and the probability model for the observed count data in our study was assumed to a normal distribution with mean given by rI and variance given by 1= t.

The duration of symptoms and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients can vary greatly, with longer durations typically observed in more severe cases. The model accounts for different recovery times based on the severity of symptoms, with a higher probability of death in critical cases, especially among older individuals. Transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual comes into contact with an infectious individual, with a probability denoted as \u03b2. The default value of \u03b2 in Covasim is 0.016, which was determined based on data from Washington and Oregon states and corresponds to a doubling time of 4-6 days and an R0 of 2.2-2.7 in a well-mixed population with 20 daily contacts per individual.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52].

Interventions such as physical distancing can alter the value of \u03b2. Individual infectiousness can vary based on factors such as disease severity and time spent in each state, with viral load serving as a key factor in determining infectivity.

As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage.
