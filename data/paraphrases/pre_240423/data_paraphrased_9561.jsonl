The first layer, which represents interactions within homes, consists of groups of varying sizes that are internally fully connected. These groups are not connected to each other, reflecting separate family units. The distribution of family sizes in Peru in April 20, 2010 was used to determine the composition of these groups, with consideration given to probabilities of families of different sizes. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

We consider random groups of varying sizes, between 5 and 30, internally connected like the \"home\" layer.

Scabini, L.C. Ribas, M.B. Neiva et al. in Physica A 564 (2021), Fig. 2 illustrates the different social layers of a proposed multi-layer network. The nodes in this network represent individuals, with weighted connections indicating potential social contacts that could lead to infection based on the edge weight (a probability value between 0 and 1). The first layer, focused on home interactions, comprises various groups of differing sizes that are internally fully connected. These groups do not have external connections, symbolizing individual families within the network. The composition of each group is determined by the distribution of family sizes in Argentina in 2010, with probabilities assigned to family sizes ranging from 1 to 10 members. Each group is required to have at least one adult member.\n\nConsidering that a significant portion of the population engages in work or economic activities that involve interacting with others, a generic layer was created to represent this aspect of social interaction. This layer links individuals between the ages of 18 and 59, which accounts for 60% of Argentina's total population. There is a wide variety of jobs and companies, therefore it is not trivial to create a connection rule that precisely reflects the real world. Here, we consider a common scenario with random groups of sizes around [5, 30], uniformly distributed, and internally connected (such as the ''home'' layer).

In Section 3.1.1, we thoroughly discuss how the transmission of a virus within a connected group relies on the edge weights, despite the nodes being fully connected. Public transport is a crucial aspect of urban areas, acting as a hotspot for potential geographical spread during an epidemic. In Argentina, the percentage of people using public transport varies based on city size, with 64.98% in capitals and 35.89% in other cities. On average, individuals spend about 1.2 hours daily on public transportation. We estimate 50% of the population participates in the ''transports'' layer, forming random groups with sizes ranging from 10 to 40 members, all fully connected. This approach accounts for the diverse nature of public transportation environments.

The model demonstrates a high overall similarity within its standard deviation. The increased number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be attributed to the rise in testing in Argentina or the consistent decline in isolation levels (below 50% for most days in the past month) [43]. We assumed a constant level of isolation similar to what was observed in the early days after government mandates in Argentina. However, data suggests that these levels are fluctuating. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the simulation may be higher than reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). The average daily death toll in the proposed models is higher than the official numbers, which is expected due to potential underdetection rates and limited testing. Analyzing death data in Argentina from January 1 to April 30, comparing figures from 2019 to 2020, reveals a notable increase after February 26, the day of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Argentina. This suggests that the actual death toll may be substantially higher than reported.
