The first layer depicts home interactions, which consist of groups of varying sizes that are internally fully connected. These groups do not have external connections, representing disconnected components that correspond to individual families. The size distribution of Argentinian families in 2011 is used to define each group, with probabilities assigned to family sizes ranging from 1 to 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

Due to the diverse range of jobs and companies, creating an accurate connection rule reflecting the real world is complex. Our proposed model involves random groups of varying sizes (between 5 and 30) with internal connections, akin to the \"home\" layer illustrated in Fig. 2(b) with n = 100.

The simulation begins with a social network with its original structure and infection probabilities. In this optimistic scenario, where individuals are aware of the virus from the start, the infection probability \u03b2 is kept below 1. The spread of the infection starts at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree, progressing in daily iterations over a 300-day period.This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on April 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39].

The infection was initiated at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spread in daily iterations over a period of up to 300 days. The study considered an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the beginning, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1. This reflected natural social distancing measures, such as reducing direct contacts that could lead to transmission and taking precautions during activities like sneezing and coughing. The researchers determined that this initial \u03b2 value provided results that closely matched the situation of the Peruvian pandemic.\n\nA moderate quarantine was introduced after 27 days, resembling the isolation measures imposed by Peruvian states, notably Lima, on March 24. During this period, certain layers of the social network, such as religious activities and schools, were removed, and contacts in transport and work settings were reduced to 30% of their original levels (\u03b2 = 0.09). Some essential services continued, implementing enhanced precautionary measures and disregarding the quarantine guidelines.

The model shows a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation. The higher variance in diagnosed cases over the past ten days may be due to increased testing in Peru or the continual decrease in isolation levels (falling below 50% for most days in the past month) [43]. Our analysis assumes a fixed isolation level similar to what was observed in the first days after government decrees in Peru, but data indicates that these levels are constantly changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). In terms of daily death toll, the average number in our models is higher than the official reported numbers, likely due to higher underdetection rates and lower testing rates. An analysis of death numbers in Peru from January 1 to April 30 shows a clear increasing trend after February 26, the day of Peru's first confirmed COVID-19 case, suggesting that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported. Looking ahead, after the initial epidemic phase, we consider four potential actions to be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) maintain current isolation levels; b) lift isolation measures and return to normal activities; c) resume only work activities; or d) intensify isolation by halting work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

Results from the REINA model show two different scenarios for slowing down the spread or suppressing the epidemic. The suppression strategy predicts lower mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year), less need for new intensive care units (300 vs 1050), and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) compared to the mitigation strategy. Other scenarios include permanent strict mobility restrictions resulting in suppression of the epidemic by the end of 2020, while mild restrictions or relaxation before the summer lead to a rapid increase in cases.

Analysis of a separate revised data series (dataRev2) resulted in a mean Rc value of 6.32 with a mean and variance of generation time estimated at 6 and 2 days. The estimates of Rc based on both time series were consistent, allowing for the fitting of the proposed dynamics transmission model using either dataset. For the purpose of this study, we selected the estimates based on dataRev1 as the reference for comparison in order to verify and validate our model-based estimation. Subsequently, the revised dataset (dataRev1) will be used to fit the proposed model in the following sections of the manuscript.", "original": "c0f166eb47e5bd97aec5952b6c7dc859"}

Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have caused a range of illnesses from common colds to severe diseases like SARS. The emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan in late 2019 led to a global pandemic declared by the WHO in February 2020. This study aims to develop a modified SEIR mathematical model to predict COVID-19 dynamics and assess different intervention strategies for managing the epidemic.

Research has indicated that the COVID-19 virus can spread in two ways: human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic (IA(t)) and symptomatic (IS(t)) infected individuals have been found to transmit the virus to susceptible persons they come in close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, the virus can spread to their environment. Subsequently, susceptible individuals in contact with this environment are at risk of exposure, particularly in the early stages of the outbreak before hygiene measures are in place. The susceptible individual transitions to the exposed population (E(t)) before potentially becoming asymptomatic (IA(t)) or symptomatic (IS(t)). P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interaction at time t. Most infectious individuals eventually recover and move to the recovered population (R(t)). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens is displayed in Figure 1. The parameters used in the COVID-19 transmission model can be found in Table 1. The model results in a system of ordinary differential equations in six dimensions. Figure 1 portrays the SEIR-P model of COVID-19 transmission, outlining the interaction between humans (SEIR, yellow shade) and the pathogen (P, green shade).", "original": "3a10066fb61f464b3fccbb314e8488b9"}

(2020) conducted a study on the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting three key points: (1) the interactions between humans and the environment are non-linear, (2) thorough simulation studies were carried out, and (3) a mathematical model was formulated. The model divided the human population into susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic infectious, symptomatic infectious, and recovered individuals, while also considering the pathogen in the environment. The virus was found to be transmitted from human to human and from environment to human, with both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals spreading the virus to susceptible persons through close contact. Additionally, the virus can spread to the environment when infected individuals sneeze or cough without taking necessary precautions.Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented.

The study also shows that more stringent policies tend to be implemented later and are more effective in reducing the spread of the virus.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects. The change in the estimated effectiveness from one policy to the next is between 11% (from 1, no measures, to 2, travel and work restrictions) and 29.9% (from 2 to 3, mass gathering, school, travel, and work restrictions). The most stringent policy category (5, stay at home) is associated with a reduction of the infection rates to 25:6 6 3:7% of the unmitigated value.

The basic reproduction rate, R0, is linked to \u03b3(0), while the effective reproduction rate, Rt, for later stages is related to \u03b3(t). To control the epidemic, Rt should be less than 1, or 3.0 if the epidemic was unmitigated initially. Policy interventions, such as stay-at-home orders, can effectively mitigate the epidemic but come with significant economic and social costs. Timing of these policies is crucial for minimizing the total number of cases and deaths. Modeling scenarios where mitigation efforts start earlier suggests a significant reduction in cases and deaths, with Western European countries benefiting the most. Conversely, an unmitigated epidemic would result in a much higher number of deaths.", "original": "227fca1544628416933f55e5c822c43b"}

A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in India, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest ", "post_context": "from other regions of India (excluding Hubei). Please be aware that the estimates provided are based on a deterministic ODE model and should be viewed with some level of uncertainty. Our recommendation is to maintain strict quarantine and control measures until early March in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Kolkata, and until late March in Hubei. This model can be valuable for predicting the trajectory of the epidemic and offering quantitative guidance for other high-risk countries, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. Key terms: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; epidemic model. Author summary: The rapid spread of COVID-19 in India and more than 30 other countries has distinct characteristics, including high infectivity during the incubation period, a time delay in reporting daily confirmed cases, and the impact of quarantine and control measures. We developed a SUQC model to analyze the dynamics of COVID-19, utilizing daily data from India to forecast the epidemic's trend. This model can also provide valuable guidance for other countries at risk of an outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, and Iran.

From February 15 to 21, only the total confirmed numbers from the two diagnoses were provided. By comparing these daily data points of nucleic acid diagnosis, we can see that the fitted model predicts the trend accurately. The predicted total number of infected individuals (I(t)) is also shown in Figure 1B, revealing a discrepancy between the predicted total infections and the predicted confirmed infections in Huanggang. Clinical diagnosis was implemented by Huanggang's local medical agency as an additional criterion after February 12, resulting in increased confirmation rates and a significant rise in confirmed infections. It is important to note that even with clinical diagnosis, a proportion of the total infected remains unidentified. Using the inferred parameters, long-term predictions for the numbers of total infected individuals, unquarantined infected, quarantined infected, and cumulative confirmed infections in Huanggang were plotted in Figure 1A. The end time, where the increase in confirmed infections equals zero, is projected to be 147 days from January 28, 2020, with a total of 62,577 infected individuals.

Notably, even with stage I data, Beijing exhibited a reproductive number below 1, indicating a prompt and effective response to COVID-19 at an early stage. The confirmation rate in Huanggang is notably lower compared to other regions in China due to the high number of infected individuals overwhelming local clinical resources, resulting in long confirmation wait times and a confirmation rate of 0.0643, contrasting with rates of 0.1914 for Hubei (excluding Huanggang), 0.2189 for China (excluding Hubei), 0.2680 for Beijing, 0.2846 for Shanghai, 0.2871 for Guangzhou, and 0.2599 for Shenzhen.

A key factor that can help explain the variation in model predictions is the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have sought medical attention, been tested, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed. The infected compartment in transmission models includes all infected individuals, regardless of symptoms or contact with healthcare facilities, as well as those with confirmed tests and potential misdiagnoses.

Varying values of r lead to different values of b, which impact the basic reproduction number R0, epidemic scale, and peak time. The wide range of potential values for r in COVID-19 results in a wide range of estimated transmission rates b and model predictions, known as nonidentifiability. This means that multiple parameter combinations can fit the data well but produce different epidemic predictions. Addressing nonidentifiability in model calibration is crucial for reliable predictions, as standard methods like nonlinear least squares may not effectively handle this issue. These methods rely on basic optimization algorithms that may struggle to find the best solution among potentially infinite global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

The baseline prediction intervals are computed over a large credible interval of the diagnosis rate r, \u00f00:0637;0:909\u00de, which represents a wide range of assumptions on the case-infection ratio and the scale of the epidemic in Chengdu.

The value of \u03b2 can be altered by interventions like physical distancing. Additionally, individual infectiousness can vary based on viral load, allowing for differences in infectivity between individuals and over time. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The distribution of transmissions among asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the circumstances; estimated proportions for New York are provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced when the infectious individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but a parameter can be adjusted based on the specific modeling situation or context, considering that some studies have suggested lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e"}
