The initial layer of the model focuses on home interactions and consists of groups of varying sizes that are internally connected but do not interact with other groups. Each group is created based on the distribution of family sizes in Argentina in 2011, considering probabilities for families ranging in size from 1 to 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

In our analysis, we assumed a consistent isolation level similar to what was seen in the early days after government decrees in Argentina.

To further explore this, we compared the number of deaths in Argentina from January 1 to April 30 between 2019 and 2020, showing an increasing pattern after February 26, the day of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Argentina.

Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs", "post_context": ").Furthermore, the study analyzed three additional scenarios. One scenario involved the permanent enforcement of strict mobility restrictions at 50%, which was projected to lead to the suppression of the epidemic by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1 and Figure 4). The other two scenarios examined the implications of mild restrictions from the outset (at 25%) or a relaxation of restrictions before the summer (increased to 30%), both of which indicated a significant increase in the spread of the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). The model output, displayed in Figure 2 on the following page, illustrates a timeline for a mitigation strategy involving the addition of new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and testing only severe cases. After a one-year simulation, there were 660000 recovered patients. The results presented are from a single simulation run, not an average of multiple simulations. Figure 3, presented two pages ahead, shows a screenshot from the model output for a suppression strategy. This strategy initially implements a 50% reduction in mobility, later reduced to 20-25%, along with aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing. After the one-year simulation, there were 77000 recovered patients. Similar to the previous scenario, these results are from a single simulation run, not an average of an ensemble.", "original": "c292ac4164c474f46812c536de11dcbe"}

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

However, the accuracy of epidemic models is limited due to uncertainty in input parameters and the potential for exponential growth to skew results.

The surveillance program utilized pooled PCR testing based on our modeling, with a focus on more comfortable AN sampling over NP sampling for increased test compliance. Cornell's ability to implement asymptomatic surveillance was made possible through a collaborative effort to increase sample collection and establish a new COVID-19 testing facility, in partnership with a local healthcare provider. Subsequent updates to the strategy were based on our simulation modeling, including increased testing for varsity athletes and students in Greek-life organizations due to higher levels of social contact.

Random sets of parameters were drawn from this prior, truncated as needed for feasibility, to create a distribution accounting for parameter uncertainty. Testing twice a week was generally effective for infection control, but larger outbreaks could occur under certain parameter settings. To analyze the impact of interventions on robustness to parameter uncertainty, a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations was developed varying in levels of pessimism regarding infection numbers.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

Previous versions of the study showed the range of the reproduction number to be between 3.30 (95% CI 2.73e3.96) and 5.47 (95% CI 4.16e7.10), with a potential increase in reporting rate.More in detail, with report rates increasing over the time, the mean value was statistically likely to be higher than 3 but less than 5. Read and coauthors (Read et al., 2020) used a deterministic SEIR model, assuming coronavirus cases being Poisson distributed and with parameter inference being achieved by maximum likelihood estimation utilizing the Nelder-Mead optimization approach. According to the dynamics transmission model, an ascertainment rate of 5.0% (95% CI 3.6e7.4) was computed and, based on this, authors estimated that as of January 22nd, 2020 in Hong Kong there were 14,464 (95% CI 6510e25095) infected individuals, and 21,022 (95% CI 11,090e33,490) infections.

Three models that incorporate data from international travels are the Imai et al. (2020), Kucharski et al. (2020), and Hong et al. (2020) models. Imai et al. (2020) estimated a reproduction number of 2.6 (range: 1.5-3.5) and found variation depending on scenarios and levels of exposure. The reproduction number ranged from 1.7 to 2.6 to 1.9-4.2. The reproduction number also varied based on estimates of generation time, from 1.3 to 2.7 to 1.7-4.3. Control measures based on data from January 23rd to January 29th, 2020 were used to predict infection rates. Measures included decreasing contact rates and adjusting susceptible population sizes after January 29th, 2020.", "original": "c14c0fd29b7bd18e7d82375caf4b235b"}

Therefore, for the human population, we can say that N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Research has indicated that the COVID-19 virus can be spread in two main ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic individuals with IA(t) and symptomatic individuals with IS(t) are able to transmit the virus to susceptible individuals (S(t)) they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without taking precautions, the virus can spread to the environment. Since the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for some days, those in close contact with that environment are at risk of exposure, especially in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak before hygiene measures are established. The disease spread starts with susceptible individuals moving to the exposed population E(t) due to an incubation period, and then to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infected individuals. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interactions at time t. Most infected individuals recover and move to the recovered population R(t). A compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is shown in Figure 1. The parameters utilized in the COVID-19 transmission model are listed in Table 1, resulting in a system of six-dimensional ordinary differential equations.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Implementing large-scale serological testing programs is crucial for proactive measures to contain the pandemic and restart the economy, aiming to keep the final percentage of infected individuals below 25% compared to an expected 90% without any measures. Our core shielding model serves as the foundation for addressing COVID-19, showcasing the conservative benefits of shielding.

In a population of 10,000,000 during a high-transmission scenario, the final epidemic predictions show 71,000 deaths in the baseline case, 58,000 with intermediate shielding, and 20,000 with enhanced shielding. For a low-transmission scenario with the same population size, the model predicts 50,000 deaths in the baseline case, 34,000 with intermediate shielding, and 8,300 with enhanced shielding. Most of the deaths are among individuals aged 60 and above, despite their lower representation in the population, aligning with estimates from other COVID-19 models and previous outbreaks. Our simulation focuses on the effects of shielding alone, while ongoing restrictions like social distancing will further reduce interactions. The effectiveness of shielding depends on a combination of factors, including demographic distribution, asymptomatic transmission rates, and immunity duration. Populations with a larger proportion of older individuals may benefit more from shielding measures. Although there are fewer recovered individuals between the ages of 20 and 60, the potential benefits of shielding remain significant.", "original": "e195534dc5936158ea4196bb28d156c8"}

Mass gathering restrictions and school closures showed the largest reductions in infection rates at 29.6% and 17.3%, respectively, while the most effective policy was stay-at-home orders, which reduced infection rates by an average of 74.4%. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model, DELPHI, can predict future COVID-19 incidence under different governmental policies. For example, Janssen Pharmaceuticals used these analyses to determine the locations for Phase III trials of their vaccine candidate. As of June 1st, 2022, there have been over 530 million confirmed cases and 6.3 million deaths globally.

Modeling shows that starting mitigation efforts earlier could have prevented a significant number of cases and deaths worldwide.

Applying the SUQC model to daily data of confirmed cases, we analyzed the outbreak in different regions of Japan.

In the model, infected individuals either go directly to being confirmed or indirectly through quarantine. By simplifying the model, the direct route is eliminated.

The parameter \u03b1 is challenging to accurately estimate, with values varying from 0.3 to 0.5 based on different methods or data sets. Fortunately, an accurate value of \u03b1 is not crucial in the SUQC model, as the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1 is sensitive to parameter optimization, balancing any bias in \u03b1 with g1. Other parameters and initial values, such as g1, \u03b2, U(0), and Q(0), are determined by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model. The expected daily time series of confirmed infections, denoted as ^C=f(g1, \u03b2, U0, Q0), is solved using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with predetermined values of g1, \u03b2, U(0), and Q(0).

It also considers the impact of individual mobility on the spread of COVID-19, a highly contagious disease. According to a report from the Imperial College London, each infected case can spread the virus to an average of 2.6 people. In each simulation, there is an initial proportion of infected and immune individuals, with the rest being susceptible. The model also accounts for mortality due to the disease. The likelihood of contagion is influenced by the proximity and contact between individuals, with higher mobility increasing the risk of infection. The simulation incorporates a distance threshold for viral transmission and a probability of contagion upon contact. The progression of the medical condition of infected individuals is also taken into consideration.Once an agent is infected, it can be in one of these sub-states: a) asymptomatic, which includes mild symptoms without hospitalization, b) hospitalization and c) severe, used in cases of hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU).

The lack of data is a significant concern for modellers, as it can greatly impact predictions. One key factor that contributes to variability in model predictions is the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have sought medical attention, been tested, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed. The infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all infected individuals, regardless of symptoms or testing status. Confirmed cases are just a fraction of the total infected population, similar to the tip of an iceberg above the water representing data, while the submerged portion represents the hidden epidemic of infected individuals not captured by testing or surveillance. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

During model calibration, it is crucial to adjust the model parameters, such as the transmission rate b, by considering the total number of infected individuals I(t) and applying the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, different estimates for the transmission rate b can be obtained by fitting the model to the data, ultimately determining the basic reproduction number R0 and other key epidemic indicators. Due to the wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio r in the context of COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary significantly, leading to a range of model predictions. This variability creates a challenge known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, where different combinations of parameter values can result in equally good fits to the data but yield markedly different projections of the epidemic. Resolving issues of nonidentifiability is essential for ensuring the reliability of model predictions. Traditional methods like nonlinear least squares may struggle to address this issue effectively, as they rely on simple optimization techniques that may not accurately identify the best model parameters among multiple potential solutions.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

The transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual comes into contact with an infectious individual, with a probability denoted as \u03b2.

Individual differences in disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and infectiousness are accounted for in the model.

Different recovery times are assigned to asymptomatic individuals, those with mild symptoms, and those with severe symptoms.

The probability of virus transmission between susceptible and infectious individuals on a given day is represented by the parameter \u03b2.

The value of \u03b2 can be altered by interventions such as physical distancing. Individual infectiousness can vary based on disease severity and time spent in each disease state, with viral load used to model infectivity differences. Studies show that viral load is highest around symptom onset, followed by a decline. We model viral load in two stages: an initial high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, the high stage lasts for 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter, with viral load set at twice the low stage.

Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage.
