The study used a social network model with original infection probabilities, starting from a node with the closest degree to the network average. The infection spread was simulated over 300 days, with daily iterations, under an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the outset, leading to an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1.This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 25 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39].

However, the epidemic also ends sooner due to natural immunity in recovered individuals. When comparing our model's output to real data from the Brazilian epidemic, we find that a \u03b2 value of 0.3 aligns better with the actual situation, where people are wearing masks and being cautious. The model generally matches the data well, with some discrepancies possibly due to increased testing and fluctuating levels of isolation.

Infection starts at a node with a degree close to the average network degree and spreads over 300 days. An optimistic scenario is considered, where individuals are aware of the virus from the start, leading to a lower initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1. This reflects natural social distancing and precautions to prevent transmission. A moderate quarantine is implemented after 27 days, reducing certain activities and contacts to 30% of their initial levels (\u03b2 = 0.09).

The model demonstrates a strong overall similarity within its standard deviation. The noticeable increase in diagnosed cases over the past ten days could be attributed to the rise in testing in Argentina or the consistent decline in isolation levels (which have been below 50% for most days in the last month) [43]. We based our analysis on a fixed isolation level similar to the levels observed in the early days after the government decrees in Argentina, but data indicates that these levels are continuously changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the future simulations may surpass what is reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section). In terms of daily death toll, the average number projected by our models exceeds the official figures, which is to be expected given the likelihood of higher underdetection rates due to fewer tests being conducted. To further explore this issue, we examined the number of deaths in Argentina from January 1 to April 30, comparing data from 2019 and 2020; the findings are detailed in Fig. 5. A clear upward trend is evident after February 26, the date of Argentina's first confirmed COVID-19 case, suggesting that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than the reported numbers.\n\nLooking ahead to future actions and their potential impacts post the initial epidemic phase, we have outlined four possible strategies to be implemented after 90 days (by May 26):\na) Maintain current isolation levels without further intervention;\nb) Ease isolation measures and resume normal activities (original network layers and weights);\nc) Restart only work-related activities while restoring initial probabilities within the layers; or\nd) Intensify isolation by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

The standard deviation is represented by the dotted lines, with the curve showing the average over a 5-day period for real data and solid lines indicating the raw data. The high number of deaths from the proposed model may be due to underdetection, as shown in Fig. 5.

This difference was then compared to COVID-19 records from the WHO [42] and Argentinian government data [44].
