Delay Dynamics of Mandatory Mask Wearing Utilizing SEIR models for the 3 scenarios outlined in the previous sections, we can determine Maximum Infected Values by simulating various delays in mask enforcement. In Scenario 1, where there is full compliance throughout mask enforcement and no time-limited immunity, Figure 3 illustrates the impact of enforcing mask wearing (a) on the day of the first COVID-19 case in Hong Kong; (b) after a 50-day delay; (c) after a 100-day delay; and (d) no enforcement at all.

This global maximum is known as the Maximum Infected Value. With no delay in mask enforcement (a), the maximum infected value is around 10.453% and peaks on day 291 after the first case. For a 50-day delay (b), the maximum infected value is about 10.479% reaching its peak on day 195. However, with a 100-day delay (c), the maximum infected value increases significantly to around 27.474%, peaking on day 103, quite similar to the scenario where no mask enforcement is in place (d).", "original": "b6d74dfbedfa805b659e1d543d58ea0a"}

A high reproduction number suggests a serious epidemic potential unless swift public health interventions are implemented, particularly during peak social contact seasons.

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

This high threshold rate of quarantine places significant demands on the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to protective measures, including reducing transmission-effective contacts and enforcing separation and restrictions during quarantine. Achieving such a high level of quarantine and contact reduction is feasible only when there are minimal imported cases from the epicenter, highlighting the importance of travel restrictions.

Testing twice a week is generally effective in controlling infections, but outbreaks may occur under certain parameter settings. To explore the impact of interventions like testing on robustness to parameter uncertainty, a family of parameter configurations with varying levels of pessimism regarding infections was developed.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change\n\nIntroduction\nOne of the notable shortcomings of the global coupled climate models within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) has been their inability to retrospectively predict key Southern Ocean climate trends, such as surface cooling, surface freshening, and sea ice expansion. The observed increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly may have played a significant role in driving these trends. Historically, climate models have overlooked the anomalous freshwater flux resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been on the rise. Recent studies suggest that incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help explain observed trends, bridging the gap between observations and simulations. The integration of Antarctic glacial meltwater also holds substantial importance.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

Therefore, for the human population, we have N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Research indicates that the COVID-19 virus can spread in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Infected individuals, both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t), transmit the virus to susceptible individuals S(t) they are in close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, the virus can spread to the environment. Since the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for a few days, susceptible individuals in close contact with the environment are at risk of exposure, particularly in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. In the transmission of the disease, susceptible individuals first become part of the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period. The exposed individuals then transition to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t). P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interactions at time t. The majority of infectious individuals recover and move to the recovered human population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is shown in Fig. 1.

Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

For a low-transmission scenario with the same population size, the final epidemic predictions are 50,000 deaths in the baseline case, 34,000 deaths with intermediate shielding, and 8,300 deaths with enhanced shielding. Most of the deaths occur in individuals aged 60 years and older, despite there being a lower number of individuals in that age range, which aligns with estimates from other COVID-19 models and outbreaks in Italy and Japan. Our simulation specifically looks at the impacts of shielding, while ongoing measures such as social distancing and shelter-in-place orders can further decrease interaction rates. The effectiveness of shielding depends on the number of potential shields identified and their substitutability, denoted as \u03b1Rshields, which combines recovered individual's identification and interaction rates. The population-scale effects of shielding are influenced by demographic distributions, the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, and the duration of immunity. Populations with a heavily right-skewed demographic distribution may benefit more from shielding, even with fewer recovered individuals between the ages of 20 and 60 to draw from.", "original": "c42e4f1d5aaa7dbc5c167f58729e4978"}

The findings showed that stricter policies, such as stay-at-home orders, were more effective in reducing the residual infection rate. The data in Table 4 highlights the different policy categories implemented across the world, with the stringent stay-at-home policy being the most widely adopted and associated with the largest decrease in infection rates compared to less restrictive measures.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects.

It is crucial for controlling the epidemic that Rt drops below 1, or 3:0, if the epidemic was unmitigated at the beginning. This implies that policy measures, such as stay-at-home orders, need to be strong enough to fully suppress the epidemic, even though this may come at a high economic and social cost. The timing of when these policies are implemented is crucial in minimizing the total number of cases and deaths. Alternative scenarios can be modeled to assess the impact of mitigation efforts starting earlier, with potential significant reductions in cases and deaths. For example, by initiating interventions one week earlier, up to 80% of deaths could have been avoided in some countries.

The lack of data is a significant concern for modellers, as it affects the accuracy of predictions. A crucial factor in understanding the variability in model predictions is comparing the available confirmed cases with the model's projections. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been tested and diagnosed with COVID-19. The infected compartment in transmission models represents all infected individuals, including those with and without symptoms, contacts with hospitals, confirmed cases, and misdiagnosed individuals. This illustrates that confirmed cases only make up a portion of the total infected population estimated by the model. To visualize this concept, one can think of an iceberg where the entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, the tip above the sea surface represents the confirmed cases, and the submerged part represents the undetected cases known as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2. In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC.\n\nWhy is this problematic for modelers? When calibrating models, estimating key parameters like the transmission rate b by fitting model output to confirmed cases data requires adjusting the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, in the model prediction by the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, we can estimate the transmission rate b and subsequently determine the basic reproduction number R0, the scale of the epidemic, and the peak time. Due to the wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary widely, resulting in a wide range of model predictions. This leads to nonidentifiability, where multiple sets of parameter values that fit the data well can generate very different model predictions. How nonidentifiability is addressed during model calibration significantly impacts model prediction reliability. The standard nonlinear least squares method may not effectively handle nonidentifiability, as it relies on basic optimization algorithms that are limited in their ability to find a global minimum of the objective function due to the presence of infinitely many global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Adopting better inference methods and model fitting algorithms can help narrow down large confidence or credible intervals. By using Bayesian inference and the affine invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we were able to achieve this goal. Our baseline predictions for Hangzhou are based on prediction intervals generated by sampling the posterior distribution. The best-fit parameter values and credible intervals can be found in Table 1. The Bayesian inference used newly confirmed cases for Hangzhou reported between January 21 and February 4, 2020, during the lockdown and travel restrictions in the city. These projections provide an estimate of the potential epidemic in Hangzhou if further control measures after February 7 had not been implemented. Figures 4(a) and (b) display the distributions of the projected peak time and estimated values of the control reproduction number R c.4 (c), we show the projected time course of newly confirmed cases in Hangzhou together with its 95% prediction interval. The fit of our model predictions and the newly-confirmed case data is shown for the period between January 21 to February 4 in Fig. 4 (d).

The duration of COVID-19 symptoms and viral shedding varies widely, with durations generally increasing based on severity. The model incorporates different recovery times for asymptomatic, mild, and severe cases, as outlined in Table 1. Recovery is assumed for non-critical cases, while critical cases have a probability of either recovering or dying, with the likelihood of death increasing with age (Table 2). Transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual contacts an infectious individual, with a probability of transmission denoted by \u03b2. In a well-mixed population with an average of 20 contacts per day, a \u03b2 value of 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of 4-6 days and an R0 of approximately 2.2-2.7. The specific \u03b2 value of 0.016 used in Covasim is based on calibrations to data from Washington and Oregon states.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8.

The parameter \u03b2, representing the transmission probability, can be affected by interventions like physical distancing. Individual infectiousness is modeled based on differences in viral load, with stages of high and low infectivity approximated by a shorter period of higher viral load. The default viral load distribution is based on international estimates and data from specific regions.

Standard transmission probabilities are approximately 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for community interactions. These values are based on a weighting of 10:2:2:1, chosen to match time-use surveys and studies on infections with known contact types, with a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population.

The value of \u03b2 can be adjusted by interventions like physical distancing. In addition to varying in disease severity and time spent in each state, individuals can differ in infectiousness, which is modeled by individual viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low state. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The distribution of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary by context, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. There are conflicting findings on whether transmissibility is reduced if the infectious individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we offer a parameter that can be adjusted depending on the modeling application or context, as some studies suggest lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e"}
