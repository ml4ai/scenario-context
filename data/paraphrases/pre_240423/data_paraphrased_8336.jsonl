We assumed a fixed isolation level similar to what was seen in the first days after government decrees in Colombia.

Dynamics of Delay in Compulsory Mask Wearing\nBy applying SEIR models to the scenarios outlined above, we were able to determine Maximum Infected Values by simulating different delays in mask enforcement. In Scenario 1, where there is full compliance with mask wearing and no time-limited immunity, Figure 3 illustrates the impact of enforcing mask wearing on (a) the day the first COVID-19 case was identified in Malaysia, (b) after a 50-day delay, (c) after a 100-day delay, and (d) not enforcing it at all. The results indicate that earlier enforcement of mask wearing reduces the Maximum Infected Value and prolongs the time to reach it. This is evident in the shift of the Infected compartment's peak to the right and a decrease in its peak value. The infected numbers rise until reaching a global maximum before declining, as predicted by compartmental models. This peak is termed the Maximum Infected Value in each scenario.", "original": "51eac5002a344b675c9f3d63b27b0167"}

The impact of travel restrictions imposed by Wuhan on infection rates in Beijing is nearly equivalent to a 100-fold increase in quarantine measures. It is crucial to evaluate how the costly and resource-intensive strategies implemented by Chinese authorities can help prevent and control the spread of 2019-nCoV, as well as determine the necessary duration of these measures. Under the most stringent measures, the outbreak is projected to peak within two weeks of January 23, 2020, with a significantly reduced peak value. Implementing travel restrictions (preventing exposed individuals from entering Beijing) could decrease the number of infected individuals in Beijing by 91.14% within seven days compared to a scenario with no travel restrictions.

Introduction Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses known to cause primarily mild respiratory infections, though they can be occasionally fatal. Since their discovery in 1965, three major outbreaks caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses have occurred: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015.

A high reproduction number suggests the risk of a serious epidemic without prompt public health interventions, especially during times of high social contact. The serial interval is crucial for accurate estimation of the likelihood function. The incubation period for Xiangtan patients with coronavirus pneumonia is reported to be between 2 to 15 days.

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

A high threshold rate of quarantine imposes a significant requirement on the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to protective measures, such as reducing contacts and following quarantine protocols. Achieving this level of quarantine rate and contact reduction is only possible when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, highlighting the importance of travel restrictions.

Understanding the local variation in disease transmission dynamics under heterogeneous geospatial attributes is a crucial step in developing more effective strategies for mitigating risk of infection in vulnerable communities.

The model categorizes the population into different groups - susceptibles, confirmed infections, hospitalized/ICU admitted, recovered, and deceased. Based on research that highlighted the significance of local air hubs and main roads in COVID-19 related hospitalization and mortality rates, we divided the model into four spatial risk groups. These groups are determined by factors such as passenger counts at airports, proximity to airports, and main highway presence.

The mortality rate of COVID-19, in particular, plays a crucial role in determining the number of infected individuals who can continue to spread the disease.Because COVID-19 mortality rate can vary substantially depending on health care infrastructure, we varied \u03bcW I by 50%. As expected, changes in \u03bcW I are immediately reflected in the number of deaths. However, compared to other clinical features of SARS- CoV-2, the mortality rate has a relatively small effect on the infected population, since < 5% of them die (Fig.\u00a04). Provincial policy and pharmaceutical interventions that were considered include NPI that reduce the effective disease infectivity (via scaling by \u03bb), vaccination rate (\u03c91), delay between the first and second vaccine doses (\u03c92,PZ and \u03c92,AZ, varied simultaneously), and", "post_context": " \u03bb and \u03c91 are varied by 5%.As NPI are scaled directly by \u03b2W, they have a significant impact on model predictions, as shown in Fig. 4.

Due to variations in dosing intervals within the population and the uncertain characterization of the vaccine escape rate, these parameters were modified by 50%. Results related to vaccines indicate that effective deployment (represented in \u03c91) is crucial in combating a pandemic, and success can be achieved even with a less-than-ideal vaccine with a higher escape rate. Prioritizing the first vaccine dose by extending the dosing interval may be advisable if vaccine supply is limited, similar to what was done in Canada. In a further analysis considering all three variants, key parameters were increased to assess their impact on infections and deaths. In addition to the parameters from the earlier analysis, factors mediating interactions between variants (\u03b2XR and \u03b7R) were also considered, with distinct values for each variant.

Given the significant differences in mass loss rates and environmental conditions among Antarctic ice shelves, it is crucial to dynamically parameterize the depth at which meltwater settles to accurately simulate high-latitude climate in a warming world. In this study, we discuss potential pathways for developing such parameterizations and address the remaining challenges. KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the notable shortcomings of global coupled climate models in the CMIP5 project has been their inability to accurately reproduce key observed trends in Southern Ocean climate, such as surface cooling, surface freshening, and sea ice expansion. The increasing anomaly of Antarctic meltwater may have contributed to these trends. Climate models often overlook the anomalous freshwater flux resulting from the net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been on the rise in recent decades. Recent studies suggest that incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help reconcile the disparities between observations and simulations. The inclusion of Antarctic glacial meltwater also has a significant impact.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

Research has shown that COVID-19 can spread in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Infected individuals with either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) can transmit the virus to susceptible individuals S(t) they come into close contact with, and the virus can also spread through sneezing or coughing in an environment. As the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for some time, susceptible individuals in close proximity to these areas are at risk of exposure, especially in the early stages of the outbreak. The disease then progresses from susceptible individuals to the exposed population E(t), who may develop into either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) individuals. The majority of infected individuals recover and transition to the recovered population R(t). The interaction between the human population and the pathogen in the environment is illustrated in Figure 1, with the parameters used in the COVID-19 transmission model detailed in Table 1. This model results in a six-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations.", "original": "3a10066fb61f464b3fccbb314e8488b9"}

In their study, a mathematical model was developed to analyze the transmission of the virus, considering interactions between human hosts and pathogens. The model categorized the human population into susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic infectious, symptomatic infectious, and recovered individuals. It was observed that the virus can be transmitted through human-to-human contact as well as from the environment to humans. Infected individuals, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, can spread the virus to susceptible individuals they come into close contact with, while transmission can also occur when infected individuals sneeze or cough without proper precautions, spreading the virus to their surroundings.Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented.

In this model, constants \u03b11 and \u03b12 represent the reciprocal of the frequency at which individuals acquire the virus from the environment and infected individuals, respectively.

Conversely, when \u03b12 = 0.05, the risk of infection from an individual is higher than from a contaminated environment. Additionally, Fig. 2c shows the rapid depletion of susceptible individuals by the 23rd day for \u03b12 = 0.05, indicating a fast spread of the virus among the population. Detailed duration information can be found in Fig. 2d-f for days 0-20.Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for \u03b12 = 0.05 , as compared to when \u03b11 = 0.05 and \u03b12 = 0.1.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

In a low-transmission scenario, the model predicts 50,000 deaths in the baseline case, 34,000 deaths with intermediate shielding, and 8,300 deaths with enhanced shielding, primarily affecting individuals aged 60 and older. These findings align with estimates from other models and real-world outbreaks. It is important to note that the effects of shielding considered here are separate from ongoing restrictions like social distancing and shelter-in-place orders. The effectiveness of shielding depends on factors such as the number of potential shields identified, their substitutability, and demographic distribution. Populations with a skewed demographic distribution towards older individuals may benefit more from shielding interventions.", "original": "e195534dc5936158ea4196bb28d156c8"}

Our predictions show that without any interventions, more than 14 million people would have died by May 17, 2020, but implementing interventions just one week earlier could have prevented 280,000 deaths worldwide. Mass gathering restrictions and school closures resulted in the largest reductions in infection rates, with a decrease of 29.6% and 17.3% respectively. The most effective policy, stay-at-home orders, led to a 74.4% reduction in infection rates across countries that enforced it. Additionally, we demonstrate how our DELPHI model can forecast future COVID-19 cases under different government policies, as seen in Janssen Pharmaceuticals' selection of trial locations for their Ad26.Cov2.S vaccine. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with over 530 million cases and 6.3 million deaths as of June 1st, 2022, is the most devastating in recent history. DELPHI, developed in late March 2020, is an epidemiological model that enhances traditional SEIR models by accounting for deaths, underreported cases, and the impact of interventions.

(2023) explored the impact of different government interventions on forecasting COVID-19. Their research showed that the implementation length and effectiveness of various policy categories, such as restrictions on travel, mass gatherings, and stay-at-home orders, differed across the world. The study found that the most stringent stay-at-home policies were implemented most frequently and were associated with the largest decreases in the residual infection rate. More restrictive policies were shown to be implemented later but were more effective in reducing the spread of the virus.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects. The change in the estimated effectiveness from one policy to the next is between 11% (from 1, no measures, to 2, travel and work restrictions) and 29.9% (from 2 to 3, mass gathering, school, travel, and work restrictions). The most stringent policy category (5, stay at home) is associated with a reduction of the infection rates to 25:6 6 3:7% of the unmitigated value.

The basic reproduction rate R0 is linked to \u03b3(0), while the effective reproduction rate Rt for t > 0 is connected to \u03b3(t). To control the epidemic, Rt must be kept below 1, or 3:0 if mitigation measures are not in place. This implies that \u03b3(t) should approximate \u00af\u03b3 times the strength of the policy implemented, such as a stay-at-home order, which can effectively mitigate the epidemic but at a significant economic and social cost. The timing of policy implementation is crucial in minimizing the total number of cases and deaths. Modeling shows that initiating mitigation efforts one week earlier could have prevented a significant percentage of cases and deaths globally. For example, countries like Switzerland, Spain, and Italy could have greatly benefited. The model also predicts that leaving the epidemic unmitigated would have resulted in a much higher number of deaths by a certain date.", "original": "227fca1544628416933f55e5c822c43b"}

A set of ODE equations is established to model the dynamics of an infectious disease and the impact of artificial factors. In this model, infected individuals can either directly transition to being confirmed cases (C) or go through quarantine (Q) first. By simplifying the model and eliminating the direct transition, the dynamics can be represented by a more concise equation.\n\nFrom the SUQC model, biologically significant parameters can be defined for monitoring and predicting disease trends. Some of these parameters include T, which represents the average waiting time from quarantine to confirmation, w, which signifies the average time delay from isolation to confirmation, and the reproductive number of the infection, R.\n\nWhen it comes to parameter inference, the cumulative number of confirmed infections (C(t)) is typically the only variable with daily observed data available for model fitting and parameter estimation. The initial value of susceptible individuals (S(0)) is usually assumed to be equivalent to the population size, while the initial confirmed infections (C(0)) are based on official reports.

However, in the context of the SUQC model, the precise value of \u03b1 is not crucial; the overall infection rate, represented by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1, is more sensitive to parameter optimization, balancing out any bias in \u03b1 with g1. By fitting the daily confirmed infection data to the model, we can determine the expected daily infection rates using the parameters g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de, and Q\u00f00\u00de.

However, the lack of data presents a more significant challenge for modellers. A key aspect influencing variability in model predictions is the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and model projections. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical care, underwent testing, and received confirmation of COVID-19 infection through DNA or imaging tests. In transmission models, the infected compartment encompasses all infected individuals, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, those in contact with healthcare facilities, individuals with confirmed test results, and those who may be misdiagnosed. Therefore, confirmed cases represent only a portion of the total infected population predicted by models. This disparity can be likened to an iceberg, where the entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, with the tip above the water surface representing confirmed cases, and the submerged portion signifying the hidden epidemic of infected individuals not captured by public health surveillance and testing.\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021).\nWhy is this a concern for modelers? When calibrating a model to estimate key parameters like the transmission rate b by comparing model output to confirmed case data, it is important to adjust for the total number of infectious individuals I(t) by using the case-infection ratio r. By varying the ratio r, different estimates for the transmission rate b can be determined, affecting the basic reproduction number R0 and other aspects of the epidemic model. Due to the wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary greatly, leading to a range of model predictions. This variability can result in nonidentifiability, where different combinations of parameters can fit the data equally well but result in very different predictions. Addressing nonidentifiability during model calibration is crucial for ensuring the reliability of model forecasts. Traditional optimization methods like nonlinear least squares may struggle to address nonidentifiability effectively, as they rely on simple algorithms to find an optimal solution in a vast search space.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

It is important to differentiate between the latent period, which is the time from infection to becoming infectious, and the incubation period, which is the time from infection to the onset of clinical symptoms like fever and cough for COVID-19. Unlike SARS, where infected individuals become infectious around two days after symptoms appear, evidence suggests that individuals with COVID-19 can spread the virus before showing symptoms.

By employing Bayesian inference and the affine invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, our fitting procedure successfully achieved this goal. Our baseline predictions for Harbin were generated by sampling the posterior distribution to create prediction intervals, with Table 1 displaying the best-fit parameter values and credible intervals.

As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage.
