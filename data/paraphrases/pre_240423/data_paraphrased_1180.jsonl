The nodes in the network represent people and are consistent across all layers, while the weighted connections indicate social interactions that could potentially lead to transmission of infection based on the edge weight (a probability value within the range of 0 to 1). The initial layer represents interactions within households, with groups of varying sizes that are fully connected internally. These groups have no connections to external networks, essentially forming disconnected components that represent individual families. To determine the composition of each group, the research incorporates the distribution of Argentine family sizes in 2011, ranging from 1 to 14 members, with consideration given to the likelihood of families having sizes between 1 and 10. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1. The first layer is then created following the family size distribution and ensuring that each family has at least one adult.

Most of the population in any given country is involved in some form of economic activity, necessitating social interaction through work. This highlights the significance of work in social relations, especially during an epidemic.

Creating a realistic connection rule is challenging due to the diverse job types and companies. We suggest a scenario with random groups ranging from 5 to 30 nodes, resembling the \"home\" layer. Additionally, public transportation plays a crucial role in urban areas but poses a risk for virus transmission due to high passenger volumes. The third layer we introduce represents public transport users without personal vehicles, accounting for approximately 50% of the population. Random groups within this layer consist of 10 to 40 nodes, reflecting varying city sizes.

There is a wide variety of jobs and companies, therefore it is not trivial to create a connection rule that precisely reflects the real world.

In Section 3.1.1, we delve into how although the nodes of a group are fully connected, the transmission of the virus is directly influenced by the edge weights. Collective transports are crucial in most cities but can also be highly crowded environments, playing a significant role in the spread of an epidemic due to constant movement. The third layer in our proposal represents public transportation, catering to individuals without personal vehicles. In Argentina, the percentage of people using public transport varies depending on the city size, with 64.98% in the capitals and 35.89% in other cities [23], with an average daily usage of around 1.2 hours. For this study, we are considering an average participation rate of 50% in the ''transports'' layer, randomly sampled from the population. Random groups are formed with varying sizes between 10 and 40, uniformly sampled, with fully connected nodes within each group. This approach accounts for the different group sizes in order to provide a more accurate representation of real-world scenarios.

The study assumed an optimistic scenario where individuals are aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1.This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic.

The model demonstrates a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation, although there has been a noticeable increase in diagnosed cases in the last ten days. This rise could be attributed to the uptick in testing in Argentina or the consistent decrease in isolation levels in the country, which have been below 50% for most days over the past month. We assumed a fixed level of isolation, based on the early days after government decrees in Argentina, but data suggests that these levels are fluctuating. Consequently, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the simulation may surpass those reported in this paper, as shown in the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section. In terms of the daily death toll, the average number from our models is higher than the official figures, which could be due to higher underdetection rates and fewer tests being conducted. This was further supported by our analysis of death numbers in Argentina from January to April, comparing 2019 and 2020 data, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The data clearly indicates a sharp increase in deaths after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on February 26, suggesting that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported.

The results of the REINA model are summarized in Figures 2 and 3, which illustrate the outcomes of a mitigation strategy and a suppression strategy, respectively, aimed at either slowing down the spread of the epidemic or reducing the number of cases.The scenarios used lazy and aggressive testing policies, respectively, and both scenarios adjusted the mobility restrictions to achieve an acceptable outcome. The two scenarios predict clearly different outcomes. The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs", "post_context": ").Furthermore, three additional scenarios were assessed. One scenario involved the continued enforcement of strict mobility restrictions (50%), which projected the suppression of the epidemic by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1 and Figure 4). The other two scenarios considered the implementation of mild restrictions from the beginning (25%) or the relaxation of restrictions before summer (30%); both scenarios predicted a rapid increase in the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3). A model output screenshot in Figure 2 illustrates the timeline of a mitigation strategy involving new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and only testing severe cases. After one year of simulation, 660,000 recovered patients were predicted. Similarly, Figure 3 displays a screenshot of a suppression strategy timeline, starting with a 50% reduction in mobility and later decreasing to 20-25%, with aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing. After one year, it was projected that 77,000 patients would have recovered. These results are based on individual simulation runs, not averages of multiple simulations.

Therefore, for the human population, the equation N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t) holds true. Research has indicated that the COVID-19 virus can spread through human-to-human contact and from the environment to humans. Infected individuals who are either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) can transmit the virus to susceptible individuals S(t) through close contact. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without proper precautions, the virus can spread to the surrounding environment. Since the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for a period of time, individuals in close proximity to these contaminated environments are at risk of being exposed to the virus, especially in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Infected individuals first move to the exposed population E(t) due to an incubation period, and then transition to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t). P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens during human interaction at time t. The majority of infectious individuals recover and move to the recovered population R(t).

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Our shielding model serves as a foundation for applying strategies to COVID-19, with potential for modifications in areas like spatial or network-based scenarios. In our model, we focus on shield immunity in the context of the pandemic, simplifying the scenario by excluding factors like births and other causes of death.

It's important to note that our simulation only considers the effects of shielding, while ongoing measures like social distancing and shelter-in-place orders also play a crucial role in reducing interactions. The effectiveness of shielding depends on the number of potential shields identified and their substitutability, denoted as \u03b1Rshields, by combining the identification and interaction rate of recovered individuals. Population-wide impacts of shielding are influenced by various factors, including demographic distributions, the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, and the duration of immunity. Populations with a demographic distribution skewed towards older individuals may benefit more from shielding.

However, the lack of data is a more significant concern for modellers. One key factor contributing to the variability in model predictions is the relationship between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical attention, were tested, and received positive results for COVID-19 through DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all infected individuals, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, those who have been tested and confirmed, and those who may have been misdiagnosed. Thus, confirmed cases represent only a portion of the total infected population predicted by the model. An analogy of an iceberg can be used to illustrate this distinction. The entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, with the visible tip above the water surface representing the confirmed cases. The submerged part of the iceberg indicates the infected individuals not detected through public health surveillance and testing, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, it is important to estimate key parameters like the transmission rate b by adjusting the model output to match confirmed cases data. To make accurate predictions, the total number of infectious people I(t) in the model must be adjusted by the case-infection ratio r. By finding the best fit between the model and data for different values of r, the transmission rate b can be estimated and used to determine the basic reproduction number R 0 and the peak time of the epidemic. However, since the case-infection ratio for COVID-19 can vary widely, the estimated transmission rate b also has a wide range, leading to a variety of model predictions. This variability in parameter values that can fit the data well but lead to different predictions is known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature. How nonidentifiability is managed during model calibration greatly impacts the reliability of predictions. Standard optimization methods like nonlinear least squares may struggle to address nonidentifiability effectively, as they aim to find a global minimum but may encounter countless such minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

In our model, we account for this by assigning different recovery times for asymptomatic individuals, those with mild symptoms, and those with severe symptoms. Non-critical cases are assumed to recover, while critical cases may recover or face a higher risk of death, particularly with increasing age. \n\nWhen a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual, there is a probability of virus transmission occurring (\u03b2). In a well-mixed population where each person has an average of 20 contacts per day, a \u03b2 value of 0.016 equates to a doubling time of approximately 4-6 days and an R0 of about 2.2-2.7. The exact values can vary based on population size, age demographics, and other factors. The \u03b2 value of 0.016 used in Covasim was derived from calibrations to data from Washington and Oregon states and is currently set as the default in the model.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52].
