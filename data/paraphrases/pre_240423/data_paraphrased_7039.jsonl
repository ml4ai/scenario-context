The initial infection was found to start at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spread in daily iterations for up to 300 days. The study focused on an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability (\u03b2) of less than 1.

The model shows a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation. The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the past ten days may be linked to increased testing in Argentina or the continual decrease in isolation levels in the country (consistently below 50% for most days in the past month) [43]. We assumed a fixed isolation level similar to what was seen in the initial days following government decrees in Argentina, but data suggests that these levels are constantly changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the future simulations may surpass those reported in this paper (refer to the \"maintain isolation\" scenario in the next section). The average number of daily deaths in the proposed models is higher than the official numbers, which is expected due to potential underdetection rates and limited testing. An analysis of death numbers in Argentina from January 1 to April 30 compared cases in 2019 and 2020, revealing a notable increase in fatalities after February 26, the date of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Argentina. This indicates that the actual death toll could be significantly higher than reported figures.\n\nMoving forward, after 90 days (May 26), we contemplate four potential actions: a) maintaining current isolation levels; b) lifting isolation and returning to normal activities (initial network layers and weights); c) resuming only work activities with initial layer probabilities restored; or d) intensifying isolation measures by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}
