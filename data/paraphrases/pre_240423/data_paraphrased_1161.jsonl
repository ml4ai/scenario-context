Scabini, L.C. Ribas, M.B. Neiva et al. published in Physica A 564 (2021) with Figure 2, a multi-layer network is proposed to analyze social interactions. Each layer of the network represents different social contacts among people, with nodes representing individuals that remain consistent across all layers. The connections between nodes are weighted to indicate the likelihood of infection based on the edge weight, which ranges from 0 to 1. The first layer simulates interactions within households, where groups of varying sizes are fully connected internally. These groups do not have external connections, reflecting disconnected components that represent individual families. The distribution of family sizes in Argentina from 2011 is used to determine the sizes of these groups, with probabilities assigned to families ranging from 1 to 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1. The first layer is then created following the family size distribution and ensuring that each family has at least one adult.

Given the diverse job landscape, creating a connection rule that mirrors reality is challenging. For example, we consider a scenario with random groups ranging from 5 to 30 individuals, internally connected like the \"home\" layer. An illustration of this layer is displayed in Fig. 2(b), with n = 100. The spread of the virus within a group depends on edge weights, details of which are explored in Section 3.1.1.

Scabini, L.C. Ribas, M.B. Neiva et al. in Physica A 564 (2021) 125498, the study examines the impact of various interventions on the progression of an epidemic, including changes in case numbers, deaths, and hospital occupancy rates. The research starts by simulating a social network with its original structure and infection probabilities. The infection initially occurs at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spreads over daily iterations for up to 300 days. The study assumes an optimistic scenario where individuals are aware of the virus from the start, leading to an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 23 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., ", "post_context": ". The activities that remain ongoing in these layers are essential services that cannot be stopped, and activities that continue while taking extra precautions and disregarding quarantine measures. In this situation, we first examine how the \u03b2 parameter affects the overall shape of the epidemic. Fig. 4(a) displays the results for 4 different \u03b2 values in relation to daily new cases and deaths, over a period of up to 300 days after the initial infection. Higher infection rates lead to a faster spread of the disease and ultimately more cases and deaths. However, the epidemic also ends faster due to natural immunity in recovered individuals.\n\nComparing the model's output in the first 83 days to real data from the Brazilian epidemic up to May 18, Fig. 4(b) shows that using \u03b2 = 0.3 provides a better fit with the actual data. This infection rate aligns with the current scenario where people are wearing masks and taking extra precautions to prevent infection. There is a notable similarity between the model's results and the actual data within a standard deviation range. The recent increase in diagnosed cases may be attributed to more testing being conducted in Brazil or a decrease in isolation levels in the country. The model assumes a fixed isolation level based on initial observations after government mandates in Brazil, although data shows that these levels are fluctuating. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the simulation may be higher than reported. Regarding daily deaths, the average number in the model is higher than the official figures, which could be due to underdetection rates and limited testing. Further analysis is needed to fully comprehend the situation.", "original": "9ea872c9f922e39c829e7d7af34e26f9"}

The recent increase in diagnosed cases over the past ten days could be linked to increased testing in Argentina. Another factor to consider is the steady decline in isolation levels, which have been consistently below 50% for most of the last month. We assumed a fixed isolation level based on early observations after government decrees in Argentina, but data indicates that these levels are continuously changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than what is reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section).\n\nIn terms of daily death toll, the average number predicted by our models is higher than official figures. This discrepancy is not unexpected as underdetection rates may be higher due to limited testing. A comparison of deaths in Argentina between January 1 and April 30 of 2019 and 2020 reveals a noticeable increase starting from February 26, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Argentina. This suggests that the actual death toll could be significantly higher than reported numbers.\n\nLooking ahead, after the initial epidemic phase, we explore four potential actions that could be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) Maintain current isolation levels and do nothing further; b) End isolation and return to normal activities with initial network layers and weights; c) Resume only work activities with initial layer probabilities; or d) Increase isolation by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

One scenario considered the permanent enforcement of current strict mobility restrictions (50%), predicting the suppression of the epidemic by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also displayed in Figure 4). The other two scenarios assessed the impact of mild restrictions implemented from the beginning (25%) or a relaxation of restrictions before summer (30%), both anticipating a significant increase in the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). Figure 2 (on the following page) presents a snapshot of the model output showcasing the timeline of a mitigation strategy involving the addition of new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and testing only severe cases. The simulation projects 660,000 recovered patients after one year. This data reflects a single simulation run, not an average of multiple simulations. Moving to Figure 3 (two pages ahead), a screenshot of the model output illustrates the timeline of a suppression strategy, which includes an initial 50% reduction in mobility later decreased to 20-25%, along with aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing.

Clinical parameters can be inferred from sero-epidemiological surveys, and the potential for spread by asymptomatic cases was recently acknowledged. A high reproduction number suggests a serious epidemic if public health interventions are not swiftly implemented during peak social contact times.

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

The close contact tracing and quarantine efforts in Hubei were found to be insufficient in comparison to the province's population size. This had a limited impact on reducing the number of infected cases and slowing the spread of the epidemic. The contour plot of R_c = 1 shows the threshold values for contact rate and quarantine rate required to prevent an outbreak in a city. Achieving this high threshold for quarantine rate would require a strong public health infrastructure and strict adherence to personal protective measures. This includes reducing transmission-effective contacts, implementing separation and restrictions during quarantine. However, this level of quarantine and contact reduction is only achievable if there are minimal imported cases from the epicenter, which emphasizes the importance of travel restrictions. Implementing strict travel restrictions to Hubei is costly and resource-intensive, presenting challenges for decision-makers and the province's resilience.

KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change\n\nIntroduction\nOne notable shortcoming of global coupled climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) has been their failure to accurately capture key Southern Ocean climate trends, such as surface cooling, surface freshening, and sea ice expansion as observed in recent years. The observed increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly may have contributed to these trends. Climate models have traditionally overlooked the impact of anomalous freshwater flux resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been on the rise in recent decades. Recent research suggests that incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help reconcile the disparity between observations and simulations, potentially shedding light on the observed trends. The inclusion of Antarctic glacial meltwater in climate models has significant implications for understanding the changing climate.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

Therefore, for the human population, the equation N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t) applies. Research has indicated that COVID-19 can spread in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) individuals infected with the virus can transmit it to susceptible individuals S(t) with whom they come into close contact. Additionally, when infected individuals sneeze or cough without proper precautions, the virus can spread to the surrounding environment. As the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for a period of time, those in close proximity to this environment, especially in the early stages of the outbreak when hygiene measures are not yet established, are at risk of exposure to the pathogen. The susceptible individual initially transitions to the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period of the virus. The exposed individual then moves on to either the asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious populations. The majority of infected individuals recover and join the recovered human population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is depicted in Figure 1. The parameters utilized in the COVID-19 transmission model can be found in Table 1. This model results in a six-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Each agent's social stratum is sampled from a uniform distribution U(1, 5) for A 1, A 2, and A 3. Total wealth in the simulation, represented by \u03b3 3, is distributed among agents based on public, business, and personal proportions defined by \u03b3 5, \u03b3 4, and \u03b3 6. The simulation begins its iteration loop after all agents are created, representing time dynamics. Each iteration, corresponding to one hour, involves agents performing actions based on their type and behaviors. Movement may bring A 1 agents into proximity with other A 1, A 2, or A 3 agents, potentially leading to contagion as explained in Section 3.3.2. Economic relationships stem from interactions between A 1 and A 3 agents, including commercial transactions, tax payments by A 4 agents, labor exchanges between A 3 and A 1 agents, and housing expenses between A 2 and A 1 agents as detailed in Section 3.3.3. Mobility patterns for A 1 agents are illustrated in Figure 1 and further specified in Section 3.3.1.", "original": "04912f39f2ebe69708e8ac5a96a44f78"}

The lack of data presents a significant challenge for modelers, as understanding how confirmed cases compare to model predictions is crucial in explaining variability in predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19 through DNA or imaging tests, while the infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all infected individuals, including those with or without symptoms, contacts with hospitals, confirmed cases, and misdiagnosed individuals. Essentially, confirmed cases represent only a fraction of the total infected population predicted by models, with the remainder resembling an iceberg metaphor where the visible tip represents the case data and the submerged portion symbolizes the hidden epidemic of infected individuals not captured by testing and surveillance efforts. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

When calibrating a model to estimate important parameters like the transmission rate b by comparing model output to confirmed cases data, it is crucial to adjust for the total number of infectious individuals I(t) in the model prediction using the case-infection ratio r. This allows for an accurate prediction of confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, different values for the transmission rate b can be determined through model fitting, influencing the basic reproduction number R0, the scale of the epidemic, and the peak time. Due to the wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary widely, resulting in a range of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, means that different combinations of parameters can fit the data well but lead to very different epidemic predictions. Addressing nonidentifiability during model calibration is crucial for ensuring the reliability of predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method often struggles to detect or address nonidentifiability, as it relies on basic optimization algorithms that may not find the global minimum of the objective function due to the presence of multiple global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

It is common to use a Poisson or negative binomial probability model for observed count data. When the mean of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is large, it approximates a normal distribution. Since the newly confirmed cases are approaching large values quickly, the distribution of the count data will be approximately normal and the probability model for the observed count data in our study was assumed to a normal distribution with mean given by rI and variance given by 1= t.
