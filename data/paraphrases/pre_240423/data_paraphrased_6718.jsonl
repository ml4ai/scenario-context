One scenario involved the permanent implementation of strict mobility restrictions (50%), which predicted the epidemic would be suppressed by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also depicted in Figure 4). The other two scenarios considered mild restrictions from the beginning (25%) or the relaxation of restrictions before summer (30%), both of which projected a rapid increase in the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). A screenshot from the model output, Figure 2 on the following page, illustrates the timeline of a mitigation strategy involving new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and testing only severe cases, resulting in 660,000 recovered patients by the end of the one-year simulation. This data represents a single simulation run, not an average of multiple runs. Subsequently, Figure 3 (two pages ahead) shows a screenshot from the model output demonstrating the timeline of a suppression strategy, which included an initial 50% reduction in mobility and later reductions to 20-25%, along with aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing. This strategy resulted in 77,000 recovered patients by the end of the one-year simulation.

The increase in Antarctic meltwater anomaly may have influenced these trends. Climate models often overlook the freshwater flux from Antarctic ice sheet mass loss, which has significantly increased in recent decades.

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the cause of a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China in late 2019 led to a global health crisis. In February 2020, the World Health Organization declared the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic. The objective of this study was to develop a modified SEIR compartmental mathematical model to predict the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic under different intervention scenarios and provide insights into the most effective interventions to mitigate the epidemic risk. Numerous researchers have explored mathematical modeling of the novel coronavirus, utilizing models developed for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to estimate transmission rates during different periods affected by intensive interventions.", "original": "3d479fb61a6401bf16f9cf209c9a0a56"}

Therefore, for the human population, the equation N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t) holds true. Research has revealed that COVID-19 can spread in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic individuals (IA(t)) and symptomatic individuals (IS(t)) infected with the virus can transmit it to susceptible individuals (S(t) they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, the virus can spread to the surrounding environment. Since the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for some time, those in close proximity to these areas are at risk of exposure, especially in the early stages of the outbreak before proper hygiene measures are put in place. As the disease spreads, susceptible individuals move to the exposed population (E(t) due to an incubation period in the host.

This results in a surge of the virus in environments like workplace, school, foodstuffs, and public transport, as shown in Fig. 2b, ultimately leading to a rise in confirmed cases of coronavirus within 10 to 35 days, as depicted in Fig. 2a. In this model, the constants \u03b11 and \u03b12 are considered to be reciprocals of the frequency with which individuals acquire COVID-19 from the environment and from infected individuals, respectively. The model in Fig. 2 demonstrates that when \u03b11 = 0.05, indicating a high risk of contracting the virus from a contaminated environment compared to an infected individual, there is an increase in the number of exposed, asymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Conversely, when \u03b12 = 0.05, indicating higher chances of getting infected by an individual compared to a contaminated environment, the number of susceptible individuals decreases rapidly, with susceptibility vanishing by the 23rd day for \u03b12 = 0.05 due to rapid spread of infection, as seen in Fig. 2d-f for the first 20 days.Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for \u03b12 = 0.05 , as compared to when \u03b11 = 0.05 and \u03b12 = 0.1.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, we apply our shield immunity model to the epidemiological dynamics of the pandemic, focusing on susceptible, exposed, and infectious individuals, as well as hospital care requirements for severe cases.

The effectiveness of shielding depends on the identification of potential shields and their substitutability, denoted as \u03b1Rshields.

In response to this crisis, we developed DELPHI in late March 2020, an epidemiological model that extends the classical SEIR model to consider additional outcomes like deaths, address underdetection of infections, and assess the impact of varying government interventions.

(2023) analyzed the impact of various government interventions on forecasting COVID-19 in their study published in Operations Research. They found that the most effective policy category was the stringent stay-at-home order, which was implemented most widely across the world. The study also showed that more restrictive policies tended to be implemented later but resulted in larger decreases in the residual infection rate. The implementation length and effect of each policy category are summarized in Table 4, with restrictions such as travel, work, and mass gatherings showing varying levels of effectiveness.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects. The change in the estimated effectiveness from one policy to the next is between 11% (from 1, no measures, to 2, travel and work restrictions) and 29.9% (from 2 to 3, mass gathering, school, travel, and work restrictions).

Policies such as stay-at-home orders have shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of the virus, although at a significant economic and social cost. Timing of these policies is crucial in minimizing the total number of cases and deaths. Modeling alternative responses, such as implementing mitigation measures earlier, can significantly reduce the impact of an epidemic. For example, starting interventions one week earlier could have prevented a significant percentage of cases and deaths globally, especially in Western European countries. Delphi predicts that a large number of deaths could have been avoided with earlier mitigation efforts.

Lack of data poses a more significant challenge for modelers. Understanding how confirmed cases align with model predictions is crucial in explaining prediction variations. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who tested positive for COVID-19, while the infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all infected individuals, including those without symptoms and individuals not captured by testing. This discrepancy between confirmed cases and total infected population is likened to an iceberg, with the visible tip representing case data and the submerged portion symbolizing the undetected infected individuals, often referred to as the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, estimating key parameters like the transmission rate b requires accounting for the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), in the model prediction by using the case-infection ratio r to predict confirmed case data accurately. By varying the ratio r, different values for the transmission rate b can be determined through model fitting, which then influences the basic reproduction number R0, the scale of the epidemic, and the peak time. Due to the wide range of potential values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary greatly, resulting in a range of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, means that different combinations of r and b can provide equally good fits to the data but lead to divergent epidemic predictions. The way nonidentifiability is handled in model calibration has a significant impact on the reliability of model predictions. Traditional nonlinear least squares methods are ineffective in addressing nonidentifiability because they use basic optimization algorithms that may find multiple global minima for the objective function.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

The differential equations for each model are as follows:\n\nS' = (cid:1)bIS \nI' = bIS (cid:1) (r + m)I \nR' = rI (cid:1) dR\n\nS' = (cid:1)bIS \nE' = bIS (cid:1) \u03b5E \nI' = \u03b5E (cid:1) (r + m)I \nR' = rI (cid:1) dRModel calibration from the data For data reliability, the data used for both models (2) and (3) is the newly confirmed cases in Shanghai city from the official reports from January 22 to February 4, 2020 (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). It is common to use a Poisson or negative binomial probability model for observed count data. When the mean of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is large, it approximates a normal distribution. Since the newly confirmed cases are approaching large values quickly, the distribution of the count data will be approximately normal and the probability model for the observed count data in our study was assumed to a normal distribution with mean given by rI and variance given by 1= t.
