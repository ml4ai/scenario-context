Public transportation plays a crucial role in most cities, serving as one of the most crowded environments that can significantly contribute to the geographical spread of an epidemic. In Argentina, a significant percentage of the population relies on public transportation, varying between 64.98% in capitals and 35.89% in other cities. On average, individuals spend around 1.2 hours per day using public transport. To represent these collective transports, we introduce a third layer in our proposal, involving individuals without access to personal vehicles. We assume that 50% of the population participates in this layer, forming random groups of sizes between 10 and 40, with fully connected nodes within each group.

The study starts with a complete social network and original infection probabilities. The virus spreads starting from a node with a degree closest to the average network degree, advancing in daily iterations over a span of 300 days. The researchers considered an optimistic scenario in which individuals are aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1.This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on April 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39].

Higher infection rates lead to faster spread of the disease and ultimately more cases and deaths.

Using a \u03b2 value of 0.3 provides a better fit for the real data, which is a reasonable infection rate considering the current scenario where precautions such as mask-wearing are widely practiced.

The increase in diagnosed cases in the past ten days may be attributed to expanded testing in Brazil or the decreasing isolation levels in the country.\n\nWhile the model assumes a consistent isolation level based on initial observations after government measures were implemented, data indicate that isolation levels are in flux.

The infection spread was simulated on a daily basis over 300 days, with an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1, representing early awareness of the virus and adherence to social distancing measures. The researchers found that this initial value of \u03b2 provided results that closely matched the Colombian pandemic data. A moderate quarantine was introduced after 27 days, similar to measures taken by Colombian states in late March. This quarantine involved reducing contacts in certain layers of the social network, with activities such as religious gatherings and schools being removed, and contacts in transportation and work reduced to 30% of their initial values (\u03b2 = 0.09). This led to a slower spread of the disease but also a longer duration of the epidemic due to reduced natural immunization. The study analyzed the impact of different \u03b2 values on the progression of the epidemic, showing that higher infection rates resulted in faster spread but also quicker resolution due to natural immunity. \n\n4.1.

The model shows a notable overall similarity within its standard deviation. The increase in diagnosed cases in Colombia over the last ten days may be due to increased testing or the consistent decrease in isolation levels in the country (which has been below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. Our analysis assumed a fixed isolation level similar to what was initially observed after the government decrees in Colombia. However, data from the same source indicates that these levels are constantly changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). In terms of daily death toll, the average number predicted by the models is higher than official numbers, which is not unexpected given the potential underdetection rates and limited testing capacity. To further explore this, we compared the number of deaths in Colombia from January 1 to April 30 in 2019 and 2020, revealing a clear upward trend starting from February 26, the day of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Colombia. This suggests that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported figures. \n\nMoving forward, we are considering four possible actions to be taken after 90 days (May 26) following the initial epidemic phase: a) maintaining current isolation levels; b) lifting isolation measures and resuming normal activities; c) allowing only work activities to resume; or d) increasing isolation by halting work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

One scenario considered the permanent enforcement of current stringent mobility restrictions (50%) and projected the epidemic would be suppressed by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also depicted in Figure 4). The other two scenarios assessed the impact of implementing milder restrictions from the beginning (25%) or easing restrictions before summer (to 30%), both resulting in a significant rise in the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). A model output snapshot in Figure 2 illustrates a timeline of a mitigation strategy involving new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and testing only severe cases. The simulation predicted 660,000 recovered patients after one year. Similarly, Figure 3 shows a screenshot of a suppression strategy timeline with initially 50% and later 20-25% mobility reduction, aggressive testing of mild cases, and contact tracing, leading to 77,000 recovered patients after one year.

Therefore, for the human population, we have N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Research has indicated that the COVID-19 virus can be spread through human-to-human contact and from the environment to humans. Infected individuals, both asymptomatic (IA(t)) and symptomatic (IS(t)), can transmit the virus to susceptible individuals (S(t)) they come into close contact with. Additionally, the virus can also spread to the environment when infected individuals sneeze or cough without precautions, putting susceptible individuals at risk of exposure. As P(t) can survive in the environment for some time, individuals in close contact with it are likely to be exposed, especially in the early stages of the outbreak before hygiene measures are put in place. The progression of the disease involves susceptible individuals moving to the exposed population (E(t)) due to an incubation period. From there, the exposed individuals can move to either the asymptomatic (IA(t)) or symptomatic (IS(t)) infectious population. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens during human interaction at time t. Most individuals recover and move to the recovered population (R(t)). The interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is illustrated in Fig. 1. The parameters used in the COVID-19 transmission model can be found in Table 1.

In this model, the constants \u03b11 and \u03b12 represent the frequency at which individuals acquire COVID-19 from the environment and infected individuals, respectively. The model indicates that when \u03b11 = 0.05, the risk of infection from a contaminated environment is higher than from an infected individual, leading to an increase in exposed, asymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Conversely, with \u03b12 = 0.05, the chances of infection from an infected individual are higher. Furthermore, in Fig. 2c, the number of susceptible individuals decreases rapidly by the 23rd day for \u03b12 = 0.05, as many people become infected quickly (Fig. 2d\u2013f show the progression from days 0 to 20).Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for \u03b12 = 0.05 , as compared to when \u03b11 = 0.05 and \u03b12 = 0.1.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

The study also found that stricter policies tended to be implemented later but were more effective in reducing the residual infection rate compared to less restrictive measures. Overall, governments should consider implementing more stringent policies to effectively combat the spread of COVID-19.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects.

Policies like stay-at-home orders can help mitigate the epidemic, but they come with significant economic and social costs. Timing of policy implementation is crucial for reducing cases and deaths. Modeling shows that starting mitigation measures earlier could have significantly reduced cases and deaths globally. For example, early intervention could have prevented over 280,000 deaths by May 17.

We have established a set of ODE equations to model the dynamics of an infectious disease and the control by artificial factors (Eq. 1). In this model, infected individuals can either go directly to being confirmed cases, or indirectly through quarantine. The direct route can be seen as a special case of the latter with zero delay time during quarantine. By simplifying the model as shown in Eq. 2, we can monitor and predict the disease trend using biologically meaningful parameters such as T=1/g1, which represents the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation, and w=1/(g2+(1-g2)), which denotes the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation. The reproductive number of the infection is R=\u03b1/g1. Parameter inference in the model involves using the number of cumulative confirmed infections, C(t), which is the only variable with daily observed data for model fitting and parameter estimation. The initial value of susceptible individuals, S(0), is assumed to be approximately equal to the population size, while the initial confirmed infections, C(0), is obtained from official reports. Note that the initial time of the ODE system does not have to be at the beginning of the epidemic, and can start from any time point during the outbreak of COVID-19.

During this time period, confirmed infection numbers are considered to be less skewed and reflect the natural characteristics of COVID-19. Initially, numbers were small and fluctuating before Jan 25, influenced by strict quarantine measures in later stages. The parameter \u03b1 is challenging to accurately estimate, with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 based on different methods or data sets. Fortunately, an exact value of \u03b1 is not crucial in the SUQC model, as the overall infection ability, measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1, is sensitive in parameter optimization. This sensitivity helps balance any bias in \u03b1. Other parameters and initial values, such as g1, \u03b2, U(0), and Q(0), are determined by fitting daily confirmed infection data to the model. The expected daily confirmed infections, denoted as ^C=f(g1,\u03b2,U0,Q0), are calculated using the model and the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The loss function, err(\u03b1,g1,U0,Q0), is optimized using the interior-point method in MATLAB to infer parameter values. Sensitivity analysis shows that the inferred values are not highly dependent on initial values.

The lack of data is a major concern for modelers, as it impacts the accuracy of predictions. The variability in model predictions can be attributed to how the available data on confirmed cases aligns with the model's projections. Confirmed cases are individuals with symptoms who have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. In transmission models, the infected compartment includes all infected individuals, regardless of symptoms or testing. This means that confirmed cases are only a portion of the total infected population represented by model predictions. An iceberg is a fitting metaphor for this discrepancy, with the visible tip above the water symbolizing the confirmed cases, and the submerged part representing the hidden epidemic of infected individuals not captured by testing or surveillance.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In the process of calibrating models, it is essential to accurately estimate key parameters such as the transmission rate (b) by comparing model output to confirmed cases data. This involves adjusting the model's prediction of the total number of infectious people (I(t)) by a case-infection ratio (r) in order to make accurate predictions of confirmed case data. The transmission rate (b) can then be determined for each value of r by fitting the model to the data, leading to the calculation of the basic reproduction number (R0), the scale of the epidemic, and the peak time. Due to the wide range of potential values for the case-infection ratio r in the context of COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary widely, resulting in a wide range of model predictions. This variability is referred to as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, as different combinations of parameters can provide similar fits to the data but yield drastically different predictions. The handling of nonidentifiability during the model calibration process significantly impacts the reliability of model predictions. Traditional optimization algorithms like nonlinear least squares are not well-equipped to address nonidentifiability, as they may struggle to identify a global minimum due to the presence of infinitely many possible solutions.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Transfer diagrams for both models are depicted in Fig. 1, with detailed explanations of model parameters provided in Tables 1 and 2. A key assumption in both models is that deaths occurring in the S, E, and I compartments during the model predictions are minimal. The differential equations for each model are presented below. Since we calibrate the models using newly confirmed case data, the death term in the R compartment has no impact on our fitting process.\n\nModel calibration from the data For data reliability, the data used for both models (2) and (3) is the newly confirmed cases in Hubei, China from the official reports from January 20 to February 4, 2020 (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). It is common to use a Poisson or negative binomial probability model for observed count data. When the mean of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is large, it approximates a normal distribution. Since the newly confirmed cases are approaching large values quickly, the distribution of the count data will be approximately normal and the probability model for the observed count data in our study was assumed to a normal distribution with mean given by rI and variance given by 1= t.
