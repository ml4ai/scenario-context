The nodes in the network represent individuals, with consistent nodes across layers. The connections between nodes are weighted to represent social contact, with the weight indicating the likelihood of infection transmission (ranging from 0 to 1). The first layer of the network depicts home interactions, with groups of varying sizes that are fully interconnected internally. These groups do not have connections to external groups, reflecting separated family units. The composition of each group is determined by the distribution of family sizes in Argentina in 2011, with probabilities assigned to families of sizes ranging from 1 to 10. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1. The first layer is then created following the family size distribution and ensuring that each family has at least one adult.

A significant portion of any country's population is engaged in work or economic activities that involve interacting with others, making work a crucial aspect of social relations, especially in times of epidemics. To represent this work activity, we suggest a generic layer connecting individuals aged 18 to 59, accounting for 60% of Argentina's total population. Given the diverse range of jobs and companies, creating connection rules that accurately reflect the real world is complex. In a typical scenario, we consider random groups of sizes ranging from 5 to 30, uniformly distributed and internally connected like the \"home\" layer. An illustration of this layer with n = 100 is depicted in Fig. 2(b). While nodes within a group are fully connected, virus transmission relies on edge weights, detailed in Section 3.1.1.\n\nPublic transportation is vital in most cities but presents a high-risk environment for the spread of epidemics due to overcrowding and constant movement. We introduce a third layer to represent public transports, encompassing individuals without personal vehicles. In Argentina, the percentage of people using public transportation varies based on city size, with 64.98% in capitals and 35.89% in other cities. On average, individuals spend around 1.2 hours a day commuting using public transport. We consider an average representation of the population, with 50% randomly selected to participate in the \"transports\" layer.

The model demonstrates a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation. The higher variation in the number of diagnosed cases in the past ten days could be attributed to the increase in testing in Peru or the consistent decline in isolation levels (below 50% for most days over the past month) [43]. Our analysis assumed a constant level of isolation similar to that observed in the early days following government mandates in Peru. However, data from the same source indicates that these levels are in flux. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the upcoming simulation may surpass what is reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section). In terms of daily death toll, the average number from our models is higher than the official figures, likely due to underdetection rates and limited testing. To delve deeper into this, we examined the number of deaths in Peru from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020, as illustrated in Fig. 5. A clear upward trend is noticeable after February 26, the day of Peru's first confirmed COVID-19 case, suggesting that the actual death toll could be significantly greater than official reports. Moving forward, after 90 days (May 26) following the initial epidemic phase, we consider four potential courses of action: a) Maintaining current isolation levels without further action; b) Ceasing isolation and returning to normal activities (restoring initial network layers and weights); c) Resuming only work activities while reinstating initial layer probabilities; or d) Enhancing isolation by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

This was preferred over nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling due to the modeling suggesting that comfort would improve test compliance. Cornell's asymptomatic surveillance was made possible through a collaborative effort to support large-scale sample collection and establish a new COVID-19 testing laboratory based on diagnostic expertise in Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine, as well as a partnership with a local healthcare provider. In response to recommendations from our modeling, the strategy was adapted for the spring 2021 semester to increase testing frequency for varsity athletes and students in Greek-life organizations due to higher levels of social contact.

The decision to use a multivariate normal distribution as a prior was based on both modeling and tractability considerations, requiring a unimodal prior with ellipsoidal contours for analysis. Random sets of parameters were drawn from this Bayesian prior, adjusted to ensure feasible values for positive and/or bounded parameters, to form a prior distribution over infections with accounting for parameter uncertainty. Testing twice a week proved effective in most scenarios for infection control, but larger outbreaks were observed under certain parameter settings. To further explore the impact of interventions such as testing on robustness to parameter uncertainty, a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with varying levels of pessimism regarding infection numbers was developed.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

Our assumptions of linearity in creating these scenarios were validated by comparing the median number of infections under various pessimistic scenarios against the q quantile of median infections, showing strong agreement. Simulated infections using biweekly testing at different levels of pessimism demonstrate that testing twice a week can keep infections below 1,000 in most cases, although some parameter configurations may result in more infections. Additional testing can reduce this risk. When test frequency is high enough, predicted infections remain low even at high levels of pessimism.

Due to the diverse mass loss rates and environmental conditions across Antarctic ice shelves, accurately simulating high-latitude climate in a warming world may require a dynamic parameterization of meltwater settling depth. In this work, we discuss the potential development of such parameterization and the remaining challenges. KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change \n\nIntroduction\nOne of the notable shortcomings of global coupled climate models in CMIP5 is their failure to accurately reproduce observed trends in the Southern Ocean, such as surface cooling, surface freshening, and sea ice expansion. The increase in Antarctic meltwater anomaly may have contributed significantly to these trends. The freshwater flux resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been increasing in recent decades, is often overlooked in climate models. Incorporating this meltwater anomaly in climate models could potentially help bridge the gap between observations and simulations. Recent research suggests that including Antarctic glacial meltwater in climate models could enhance our understanding of observed trends.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

Both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) individuals transmit the virus to susceptible persons S(t) they come into contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, the virus can spread in the environment. Since the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for days, individuals in close contact with infected environments, especially in the early stages of the outbreak, are at risk of exposure. Infected individuals progress from the exposed population E(t) to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) groups. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens during human interaction at time t. Most infected individuals recover and move to the recovered population R(t).

In this model, constants \u03b11 and \u03b12 represent the frequency at which individuals acquire COVID-19 from the environment and from infected individuals, respectively.

This approach focuses on individuals who are susceptible, infectious, or recovered from a virus, with the goal of identifying and promoting immunity.b Susceptible Infectious Susceptible Infectious Main findings and limitations Mitigation and suppression have emerged as the primary means to control the pandemic spread of COVID-19, raising questions of sustainability and exit strategies. Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2. Several scenarios have been explored that show substantive decreases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to baseline given enhanced interactions with recovered individuals that reduce the risk of transmission.", "post_context": "Policy implications Our findings reinforce the need for large-scale, serological testing initiatives to identify individuals who have recovered from COVID-19.While uncertainties persist regarding the length and effectiveness of immunity, strategically identifying and deploying recovered individuals offers an opportunity to decrease transmission for the greater good. Implementing large-scale serological testing efforts is crucial for proactive measures to end the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate economic recovery, ultimately resulting in fewer than 25% of the population being infected compared to an anticipated 90% without protective measures. Our shielding model serves as the foundation for applying strategies to COVID-19, showcasing the conservative advantages of shielding. Furthermore, more complex models considering various factors like spatial dynamics or network effects could yield further insights. In this analysis, we apply our shield immunity model to the epidemiological patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak. For simplicity, we do not account for births or other mortality causes.

The lack of data is a significant concern for modellers, as it can affect model predictions. Comparing available data (confirmed cases) with model predictions is crucial in understanding the variability in these predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been tested and diagnosed with COVID-19, while the infected compartment in transmission models includes all infected individuals, whether symptomatic or not, who may or may not have been confirmed through testing. Model predictions often represent a larger infected population compared to confirmed cases, similar to an iceberg where the tip above the water surface represents the confirmed cases and the submerged portion symbolizes the hidden epidemic of individuals not captured by testing or surveillance. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirmed cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

When calibrating models, it is crucial to estimate key parameters like the transmission rate b by matching model output with confirmed cases data. To do this accurately, the total number of infectious individuals I(t) must be adjusted by the case-infection ratio r in order to predict confirmed cases effectively. This process helps determine the basic reproduction number R 0, epidemic scale, and peak time. Since the case-infection ratio r for COVID-19 can vary widely, the estimated transmission rate b also has a wide range, leading to diverse model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability, poses a challenge in determining unique model parameters from data during calibration. Different combinations of r and b that fit the data well can result in vastly different predictions. Detecting and addressing nonidentifiability is crucial for improving the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method may not be effective in addressing this issue due to its reliance on basic optimization algorithms that may not find the best solution among many possible global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual, with a probability of \u03b2.

Variability in the duration of COVID-19 symptoms and viral shedding has been noted, with longer durations typically associated with more severe cases. Our model reflects this by assigning different recovery times for asymptomatic cases, mild cases, and severe cases, as detailed in Table 1. Non-critical cases are assumed to recover, while critical cases have the possibility of recovery or death, with the likelihood of death increasing with age (Table 2). The transmission of the virus and within-host viral dynamics are modeled such that when a susceptible individual encounters an infectious individual, the virus is transmitted with a certain probability (\u03b2).
