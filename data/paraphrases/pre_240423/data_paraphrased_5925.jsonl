The first layer focuses on home interactions and consists of groups of varying sizes that are fully connected internally. These groups do not have external connections, reflecting disconnected components representing individual families. The distribution of family sizes in Argentina in 2009, ranging from 1 to 14 members, is considered to determine the size of each group, with probabilities assigned to families with sizes from 1 to 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1. The first layer is then created following the family size distribution and ensuring that each family has at least one adult.

Our proposed third layer focuses on these public transports, catering to individuals without personal vehicles. In Argentina, the percentage of public transport users varies based on city size, with 64.98% in capitals and 35.89% in other cities [23], typically spending an average of 1.2 hours a day on public transport.

The simulation began with an initial social network structure and infection probabilities. The virus was introduced at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spread over daily iterations for up to 300 days. The study assumed an optimistic scenario where individuals are aware of the virus from the start, leading to an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1.This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 25 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39].

Higher infection rates lead to a faster spread of the disease and ultimately more cases and deaths. Conversely, the epidemic concludes more quickly due to natural immunity in recovered individuals. When compared to real data from the Brazilian epidemic up to May 18, using \u03b2 = 0.3 provides a closer fit to the actual scenario where mask-wearing and precautionary measures are common. The model aligns well with the data within standard deviation, although variations in diagnosed cases and deaths may be attributed to increased testing and fluctuating isolation levels.

The initial spread of the virus started at a node with a degree closest to the network average, with daily iterations lasting up to 300 days. In their analysis, the researchers considered an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the beginning, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1.

The study found that this starting value of \u03b2 provided results that closely matched the Colombia pandemic data.\n\nAfter 27 days, a moderate quarantine was introduced to simulate the measures implemented by most Colombian states on March 24. This quarantine involved removing certain social layers (such as religious activities and schools) and reducing contacts in transportation and workplaces to 30% of their initial levels (\u03b2 = 0.09). Activities that continued at full capacity represented essential services or those taking extra precautions. The researchers analyzed how varying the \u03b2 parameter affected the epidemic curve, with the results illustrated in Fig. 4.

The recent increase in diagnosed cases in Colombia over the last ten days may be attributed to the rise in testing or the decreasing isolation levels in the country, which have been consistently below 50% for most days of the past month. We assumed a fixed isolation level similar to what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Colombia, but data indicates that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than what is reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). The average daily death toll predicted by the models is higher than the official numbers, likely due to underdetection rates and limited testing. Analysis of the number of deaths in Colombia from January 1 to April 30 shows a clear increasing pattern after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on February 26, suggesting that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported. \n\nLooking ahead, after the initial epidemic phase, we are considering four potential courses of action following 90 days (May 26): a) Maintaining current isolation levels without further action; b) Ending isolation and returning to normal activities with initial network layers and weights; c) Resuming only work activities with restored initial layer probabilities; or d) Increasing isolation by suspending all remaining activities related to work and transport.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

The discrepancy in total deaths between these records and those reported by the WHO and the Argentinian government suggests a significant underdetection of COVID-19 cases.
