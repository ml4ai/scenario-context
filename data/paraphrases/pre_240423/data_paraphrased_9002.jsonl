The study simulated an epidemic starting at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree, spreading over 300 days in iterations of 1 day. The researchers assumed an optimistic scenario in which individuals are informed about the virus from the outset, leading to an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on April 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39].

Higher infection rates result in faster spread of the disease and a greater number of cases and deaths. However, the epidemic also ends more quickly due to natural immunity among those who have recovered.\n\nWhen comparing the model's output for the first 83 days with real data from the Brazilian epidemic up to May 18, a better fit is achieved with a \u03b2 value of 0.3.

The spread of infection began at a node with a degree closest to the network's average, progressing daily for up to 300 days. Initially, a scenario was considered where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability (\u03b2) of less than 1.

The mean and variance of the prior for each parameter were chosen to result in a symmetric 95% Bayesian credible interval that aligned with plausible ranges for each parameter. Utilizing a multivariate normal distribution as a prior was necessary for modeling and tractability reasons. We needed a unimodal prior with ellipsoidal contours for the analysis that followed, making the multivariate normal the ideal choice. Random sets of parameters were drawn from this Bayesian prior, with values appropriately truncated to ensure feasibility, particularly for parameters known to be positive or bounded. Simulations were run for each set of parameters, creating a prior distribution over infections while considering parameter uncertainty. Our findings suggest that 2\u00d7/wk testing is generally effective for infection control, but large outbreaks could occur under certain parameter settings. To better understand how interventions like testing can impact robustness to parameter uncertainty, we developed a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with varying levels of pessimism regarding the number of infections. These methods are detailed in the results and supplementary information.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

Comparing infections under various pessimistic scenarios to infection medians drawn from the prior suggests our assumption of linearity had minimal effect on the level of pessimism in our scenarios. Simulated infections using biweekly testing at different levels of pessimism show that testing can effectively control infections, but in some cases, infection numbers can exceed 1,000, especially in highly pessimistic scenarios. Additional testing reduces this risk, with infections remaining low even at high levels of pessimism.

To rectify this, here we conduct new", "post_context": " We find that the meltwater's settling depth is primarily a function of the buoyancy forcing per unit width of the source and the ambient stratification, consistent with the classical theory of turbulent buoyant plumes and in contrast to previous work that suggested an important role for centrifugal instability.Our findings emphasize the important role of localized variability in stratification in explaining the observed interannual variability in vertical meltwater distribution near Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica. Given the significant differences in mass loss rates and environmental conditions across Antarctic ice shelves, incorporating dynamic parameters for meltwater settling depth is essential for accurately simulating high-latitude climate in a warming world. In this paper, we discuss how such parameterization can be developed based on our findings and identify the remaining challenges. KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change \n\nIntroduction\nOne notable deficiency in global coupled climate models included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012) has been their inability to accurately reproduce key observed trends in the Southern Ocean, such as surface cooling, surface freshening, and sea ice expansion (Turner et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2016; Kostov et al. 2018). The Antarctic meltwater anomaly has been increasing over recent decades, potentially influencing these trends (Rye et al. 2020). Current climate models often overlook the impact of this freshwater anomaly resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been on the rise, reaching around 500 Gt yr 2019 (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019). Recent studies suggest that incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help resolve the disparities between observations and simulations, shedding light on the observed trends (Bintanja et al. 2013; Rye et al. 2014; Bintanja et al. 2015; Rye et al. 2020). The inclusion of Antarctic glacial meltwater could have significant implications for modeling climate change.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

This study aims to develop a modified SEIR compartmental mathematical model to predict COVID-19 epidemic dynamics and evaluate various intervention strategies to reduce the risk of the epidemic.

Therefore, for the human population, N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Research has shown that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) infected individuals spread the virus to susceptible individuals S(t) they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals sneeze or cough without taking necessary precautions, the virus can spread to the environment. As the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for several days, individuals in close contact with this environment are at a higher risk of exposure, especially in the early days of the outbreak before hygiene protocols are put in place. The disease spreads as susceptible individuals first move to the exposed population E(t) due to an incubation period. The exposed individuals then move to either the asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious population. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interaction at time t. Most infectious individuals recover and move to the recovered human population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and the pathogens in the environment is presented in Fig. 1, with the parameters used in the COVID-19 transmission model outlined in Table 1.

The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of Japan excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid-March for Japan excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in Japan, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest", "post_context": "from other regions of Japan (excluding Hubei). The estimates presented are based on a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. Our findings suggest that strict quarantine and control measures should be maintained in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen until early March, and in Hubei until late March. This model can be valuable in predicting the trajectory of the epidemic and offering guidance for countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in Japan and more than 30 countries, with unique characteristics including high infectivity during the incubation period, time delays in reporting confirmed cases, and the impact of interventions like quarantine. We have developed a SUQC model to analyze the dynamics of COVID-19, using Japan's daily data to forecast the epidemic's progression and providing guidance for other nations facing similar risks.

We have established a set of differential equations to simulate the spread of an infectious disease and the impact of artificial interventions. In this model, individuals either directly transition from being unquarantined (U) to confirmed (C), or indirectly go through quarantine (Q). By considering the latter as a special case with zero delay time, we simplified the model to exclude the direct method (Eq. 2). The model parameters T, representing the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation, and w, representing the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation, can provide insights into disease trends.

By fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model, we determine the values of g1, \u03b2, U(0), and Q(0).

The lack of data is a more significant concern for modelers, as it can impact the variability in model predictions. A key issue in understanding this variability is comparing the available data in confirmed cases with model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been in contact with a hospital, undergone testing, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed through DNA or imaging tests. In transmission models, the infected compartment represents all individuals who are infected, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, have contacts with hospitals, have confirmed test results, or are misdiagnosed. Confirmed cases thus only make up a portion of the total infected population predicted by the model. This discrepancy between data and predictions can be illustrated using an iceberg metaphor, with the visible tip of the iceberg representing the confirmed cases and the hidden portion underneath the surface symbolizing the unidentified population of infected individuals, often referred to as the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021). Why should this pose a challenge for modelers? In model calibration, estimating crucial model parameters like the transmission rate b requires adjusting the model output to match the confirmed cases data. This involves discounting the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), from the model prediction by the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed cases. By varying the ratio r, different values for the transmission rate b can be determined through data fitting, affecting important epidemic factors such as the basic reproduction number R0 and the peak time. Due to the wide range of potential case-infection ratios for COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary widely, resulting in a range of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in modeling, means that multiple combinations of r and b can fit the data well but lead to vastly different epidemic forecasts. The way nonidentifiability is dealt with during model calibration impacts the reliability of predictions. Traditional methods like nonlinear least squares may struggle with nonidentifiability due to their basic optimization algorithms, which aim to find a global minimum but face numerous potential minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

The latency of COVID-19 is biologically realistic, as the virus can have an incubation period of up to 14 days, during which newly infected individuals may not be infectious. It is important to differentiate between the latent period, the time from infection to infectiousness, and the incubation period, the time between infection and the appearance of clinical symptoms like fever and cough. For SARS, individuals become infectious around two days after symptoms appear (WHO, 2003), making the SARS latent period longer than the incubation period. On the other hand, evidence suggests that individuals with COVID-19 can be infectious before symptoms appear (Bai et al., 2020), though the length of the latent period is uncertain. Compared to the SIR model, the SEIR model is more biologically realistic but has the downside of requiring two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population.

The transmission of the virus occurs with a probability of \u03b2 when a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual. In a well-mixed population with an average of 20 contacts per day, a value of \u03b2 = 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of 4\u20136 days and an R0 of approximately 2.2\u20132.7.

Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8.

Interventions like physical distancing can impact the value of \u03b2. We allow for variations in disease severity, time spent in each state, and individual infectiousness, which is influenced by viral load. Our model incorporates two stages of viral load, with the high stage lasting for a shorter duration at a higher level. Viral load distributions are based on international data and adjusted daily to reflect transmission probability.

The duration of COVID-19 symptoms and viral shedding varies but generally increases with severity. In the model, recovery times differ for asymptomatic, mild, and severe cases. Critical cases may recover or result in death, with the probability of death rising with age. The transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual comes into contact with an infectious individual, with a probability denoted as \u03b2. In a well-mixed population with an average of 20 contacts per day, a \u03b2 value of 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of 4-6 days and an R0 of 2.2-2.7. The exact value varies based on population size, age structure, and other factors. The default \u03b2 value of 0.016 in Covasim was calibrated using data from Washington and Oregon states.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type.

When combined with factors such as age-based susceptibility and the default number of contacts in each layer, the distribution of transmission events in the absence of interventions is estimated to be approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The \u03b2 value, which represents the transmission probability, can be influenced by interventions like physical distancing. Infectiousness and disease severity can vary among individuals, and we account for differences in infectivity by modeling individual viral load levels. This model includes two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. The default parameters for viral load, drawn from a negative binomial distribution, are based on international estimates and data from Washington state and Oregon. The daily viral load is used to adjust the per-contact transmission probability for each individual. This approach is shown in Fig 2, which displays the viral loads for a representative sample of individuals.", "original": "3c6f7ea7e01e06b68489c51c672c9489"}

If a realistic network structure is considered (incorporating households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts), the value of \u03b2 will vary depending on the type of contact. The default transmission probabilities are approximately 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community, with relative weightings of 10:2:2:1. These values were chosen to align with time-use surveys and previous studies on infections with known contact types, resulting in a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population. In an unmitigated transmission scenario, the distribution of transmission events across contact layers is estimated to be around 30% in households, 25% in workplaces, 15% in schools, and 30% in the community. Interventions, such as physical distancing, can also impact the value of \u03b2. Furthermore, we allow for variations in disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and infectiousness among individuals using individual viral load to model differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load for each agent is drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean 1.0 and shape ", "post_context": ", which was the value most consistent with both international estimates [59,60] and fits to data in Washington state. The per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an agent is adjusted based on the daily viral load. Figure 2 displays viral loads for a representative sample of individuals with default parameter values. The proportions of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the context, with estimated ratios for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is affected by the presence of symptoms in the infectious individual [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted based on the modeling application or context. It is worth noting that some studies have used significantly lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e"}
