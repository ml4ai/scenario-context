In this network, nodes represent people and remain constant across layers. The connections between nodes are weighted to represent social contact, with the weight indicating the probability of infection (ranging from 0 to 1). The first layer depicts home interactions, where groups of varying sizes are fully connected internally. These groups do not have external connections, initially forming disconnected components that represent individual families. The family sizes in each group are determined based on the distribution of Argentine family sizes in 2011, considering probabilities for family sizes ranging from 1 to 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1. The first layer is then created following the family size distribution and ensuring that each family has at least one adult.

We assumed a fixed isolation level similar to the early days after government decrees in Peru, but data indicates that these levels are changing constantly. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than what is reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). The average number of daily deaths projected by the model is higher than the official numbers, which is expected due to potential underdetection rates and a lower number of tests being conducted.

With a 50-day delay (b), the maximum infected value is approximately 10.479%, and the peak occurs on day 195.

One scenario involved maintaining strict mobility restrictions at 50%, which resulted in the prediction of epidemic suppression by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also depicted in Figure 4). The other scenarios explored the effects of implementing milder restrictions from the start at 25% or easing restrictions before the summer to 30%, both of which projected a significant increase in the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). A simulation output displayed in Figure 2 illustrates the timeline of a mitigation strategy, including the addition of new hospital beds, a 30-40% mobility restriction, and testing only severe cases. The model predicted 660000 recovered patients at the end of a one-year simulation. Similarly, a simulation output in Figure 3 presents the timeline of a suppression strategy, involving an initial 50% mobility reduction and subsequent reduction to 20-25%, coupled with aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing. The model projected 77000 recovered patients at the end of a one-year simulation. It is important to note that these results are based on a single simulation run, not an average of an ensemble.", "original": "c292ac4164c474f46812c536de11dcbe"}

They typically cause mild respiratory infections but can be fatal. Since their discovery in 1965, there have been three major outbreaks caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses: the SARS outbreak in mainland China in 2003, the MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015.", "original": "134ae663525a1627e0f0f8ddf71bd2a9"}

The choice of a multivariate normal distribution as the prior was made to address modeling and tractability concerns, requiring a unimodal prior with ellipsoidal contours for subsequent analysis. Random sets of parameters were drawn from this Bayesian prior, with appropriate truncation to maintain feasibility for positive and/or bounded parameters, forming a prior distribution over infections while accounting for parameter uncertainty. When considering various parameter settings, it was determined that 2\u00d7/wk testing is generally adequate for infection control, although large outbreaks are possible under certain circumstances. To examine the impact of interventions on robustness to parameter uncertainty, a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with differing levels of pessimism regarding infection numbers was developed.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

This relationship is illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig. S15. To assess the impact of linearity assumptions in creating these scenarios, we compared the median number of infections under pessimistic scenarios against the median infections drawn from the prior for varying levels of pessimism. We found a strong agreement, indicating that the linearity assumption minimally affected the level of pessimism in our scenarios. Simulated infections were plotted using 2\u00d7/wk testing across different levels of pessimism, showing that this level of testing can generally keep infections below 1,000 except for the most pessimistic parameter configurations. Additional testing can help mitigate this risk, with predicted infections remaining low even at high levels of pessimism.

By the end of the year, it is estimated that 71% of the population will have received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 57% will be fully vaccinated. Approximately 11,000 people will have died from COVID-19 by the end of 2031, with different percentages attributed to the wild type, Alpha, and Delta variants. These predictions align closely with the reported data of 750,000 infections and 10,200 deaths in Ontario. The population dynamics show a decline in susceptible individuals after December 2030, primarily due to vaccination efforts. By the end of June 2031, only 37% of the population will still be susceptible to the virus.

This indicates that the Chinese authorities effectively controlled the epidemic outbreak in Hubei. To analyze the local stability in relation to the basic reproduction number, we note that certain equations in system (1) are not interlinked with the rest. By integrating these equations directly, we can derive the following analytical outcomes. Moreover, given that the total population size N remains constant, the stability of model (1) can be assessed through the interconnected state variables E, I, P, and H.

Research has shown that COVID-19 can be transmitted through human-to-human contact and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic (IA) and symptomatic (IS) individuals infected with the virus can spread it to susceptible individuals (S) they come into close contact with. When infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, the virus can also spread to the environment, where it can survive for days and expose susceptible individuals. This is particularly true in the early stages of the outbreak before proper hygiene measures are put in place. The disease spread starts with susceptible individuals moving to the exposed population (E), followed by progression to either asymptomatic (IA) or symptomatic (IS) infectious populations. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interactions at time t. Infected individuals mainly recover and move to the recovered population (R).\n\nThe compartmental model in Figure 1 illustrates the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment.

Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Our findings show that without interventions, over 14 million individuals would have died by May 17, 2020. Implementing interventions one week earlier could have prevented 280,000 deaths globally. Mass gathering restrictions and school closures resulted in the largest reductions in infection rates, with reductions of approximately 29.6% and 17.3% respectively. The most effective policy, stay-at-home orders, led to an average reduction of 74.4% in infection rates across countries that implemented it.

(2023) examined the effectiveness of various government interventions in forecasting COVID-19 cases. The study found that the implementation of more stringent policies, such as stay-at-home orders, led to significant reductions in the residual infection rate. These policies, including mass gathering restrictions and limitations on travel and work, were implemented later but had a greater impact on reducing the spread of the virus. Stay-at-home orders were the most widely implemented policy category globally.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects.

Controlling the epidemic requires Rt to be less than 1, or 3.0 if the epidemic was unmitigated at t = 0. Policy interventions, such as stay-at-home orders, are crucial in mitigating the epidemic, albeit at a significant economic and social cost. Timing of these interventions is key in minimizing the total number of cases and deaths. Modeling alternative initial responses can provide insights into the impact of implementing mitigation measures earlier. For example, starting interventions a week earlier could have led to a significant reduction in cases and deaths worldwide. Countries like Switzerland, Spain, and Italy could have benefited the most, with potentially avoiding around 280,000 deaths by May 17.

Estimating the parameter \u03b1 accurately has proven to be challenging, with values varying from 0.3 to 0.5 using different methods or data sets. However, in the SUQC model, the exact value of \u03b1 is not crucial, as the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1 is a sensitive compound parameter that can balance out any bias in \u03b1. Other parameters and initial values are estimated by fitting the daily confirmed infection data to the model. The expected daily time series of confirmed infections, denoted as ^C, is derived from the model using specific parameter values. The loss function is then optimized using the interiorpoint method in MATLAB to determine the parameter values. Notably, the weight given to later observations in the loss function could be excessive due to higher cumulative case numbers. Different weighted loss functions have been explored to better incorporate information from the entire epidemic.", "original": "da36c1f3037e4009701d4b09b0a6c11a"}

Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation.

However, the lack of data poses a more significant challenge for modelers. A crucial factor contributing to variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) aligns with the model's projections. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical attention, underwent testing, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed through various methods. In transmission models, the infected compartment encompasses all infected individuals, regardless of symptoms, healthcare interactions, or testing outcomes. Therefore, the confirmed cases represent just a fraction of the total infected population predicted by the model. This disparity can be likened to an iceberg, where the visible tip above the water's surface symbolizes the confirmed cases, while the submerged portion signifies the hidden epidemic of undetected infections within the population.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2.

When calibrating a model, it is necessary to adjust the total number of infectious individuals from the model's prediction by a case-infection ratio in order to accurately predict confirmed case data for key parameters such as the transmission rate. This process helps determine important outcomes of the epidemic, such as the basic reproduction number and peak time. However, the wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19 can result in a wide range of estimated transmission rates, leading to a variety of model predictions. This nonidentifiability, where multiple parameter combinations can fit the data equally well but lead to different outcomes, is a common challenge in modeling. Addressing nonidentifiability in model calibration is crucial for reliable predictions, as standard optimization methods may struggle to identify the best parameter values.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Non-critical cases are expected to recover, while critical cases may recover or pass away, with the likelihood of death rising with age (Table 2). In terms of transmission and within-host viral dynamics, when a susceptible individual encounters an infectious individual, there is a probability \u03b2 of virus transmission. In a well-mixed population where each person has around 20 contacts per day, a \u03b2 value of 0.016 equates to a doubling time of about 4-6 days and an R0 of roughly 2.2-2.7, depending on factors like population size and age structure. The default \u03b2 value of 0.016 in Covasim was calibrated using data from Washington and Oregon.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52].
