The nodes in the network represent people, with consistent node identities across all layers. The weighted connections between nodes indicate social contacts that may result in infection based on the edge weight, which is a probability value ranging from 0 to 1. The first layer of the network showcases home interactions, consisting of groups with different sizes that are internally fully connected. These groups do not have connections outside of their own group, essentially representing disconnected components symbolizing individual families. The sizes of the family groups are determined based on the Argentinian family size distribution data from 2012, with consideration given to the probability of families having sizes between 1 and 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

A significant portion of the population in any country must be employed or engaged in economic activities that require interaction with others. Work is a crucial aspect of social relations, especially during an epidemic. To model work interactions, we propose a generic layer for individuals aged 18-59, which makes up 60% of Argentina's population. Given the diversity of jobs and companies, creating a connection rule that accurately reflects reality is challenging. In our model, we consider random groups of individuals ranging from 5 to 30, uniformly distributed and internally connected, similar to the \"home\" layer. This is illustrated in Fig. 2(b) for n = 100. The spread of the virus among group nodes depends on the edge weights, as discussed in Section 3.1.1. Public transportation is crucial in most cities but also poses a risk for spreading epidemics due to high population density. We introduce a third layer to represent public transport, catering to individuals without personal vehicles. In Argentina, public transport usage varies depending on city size, with rates of 64.98% in capitals and 35.89% in other cities, averaging around 1.2 hours of use per day.

Delay Dynamics of Mandatory Mask Wearing\nBy applying SEIR models to the scenarios outlined above, we were able to determine the Maximum Infected Values by simulating various delays in mask enforcement. In Scenario 1, where there is full compliance and no time-limited immunity, Figure 3 illustrates the impacts of enforcing mask wearing on different timelines: (a) on the day of the first COVID-19 case detection in Malaysia; (b) after a delay of 50 days; (c) after a delay of 100 days; and (d) not enforced at all.\n\nFrom the data in Figure 3, we can see that earlier implementation of mask wearing not only reduces the Maximum Infected Value but also extends the time taken to reach this maximum value. The peak of the Infected compartment shifts to the right, indicating a lower maximum value in the infected curve. The infected number increases until reaching a global maximum before declining, as predicted by compartmental models. This global maximum is referred to as the Maximum Infected Value.\n\nFor instance, with no delay in mask enforcement (a), the maximum infected value is around 10.45% and peaks on day 291 post the first case detection. With a delay of 50 days (b), the maximum infected value increases slightly to about 10.48% with a peak on day 195. However, with a delay of 100 days (c), the maximum infected value significantly rises to approximately 27.47% with a peak on day 103, similar to the scenario of no mask enforcement (d).", "original": "b6d74dfbedfa805b659e1d543d58ea0a"}

Achieving this high threshold rate of quarantine requires a strong public health infrastructure and strict adherence to personal protective measures.

The mean and variance of the prior for each parameter were selected to create a symmetric 95% Bayesian credible interval that aligned with plausible ranges for each parameter. The decision to use a multivariate normal distribution as a prior was driven by both modeling and tractability considerations. We needed a unimodal prior with ellipsoidal contours to facilitate the subsequent analysis, making the multivariate normal distribution the natural choice. Random sets of parameters were sampled from this Bayesian prior, with appropriate truncation to ensure feasible values for parameters that are known to be positive and/or bounded. Our simulation then generated a prior distribution over infections, taking into account parameter uncertainty. While 2\u00d7/wk testing is generally effective for infection control, large outbreaks can still occur under certain parameter settings. To examine the impact of interventions such as testing in the face of parameter uncertainty, we constructed a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with varying degrees of pessimism regarding infection levels. This approach helped us better understand how interventions affect resilience to parameter uncertainty.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

Simulated infections using 2\u00d7/wk testing show that infections can be kept below 1,000 in almost all parameter configurations, except for the most pessimistic ones. Additional testing can help reduce this risk. When test frequency is high enough, predicted infections remain low even at high pessimism levels.

Research shows that COVID-19 can spread through human-to-human contact and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic (IA(t)) and symptomatic (IS(t)) infected individuals can transmit the virus to susceptible individuals (S(t)) they come in close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, the virus can spread to the environment, where it can survive for several days, potentially exposing susceptible individuals in close proximity. This exposure is more likely in the early stages of the outbreak before proper hygiene measures are established. The disease transmission progresses from susceptible to exposed, then either to asymptomatic or symptomatic infected populations, with recovered individuals moving to the R(t) category. The interaction between the human population and the environment pathogens is depicted in Figure 1, with the parameters for the COVID-19 transmission model outlined in Table 1.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Our core shielding model serves as the foundation for applying this concept to COVID-19, with the potential for further adjustments based on detailed mixing and substitution models in specific geographic areas or networks. In this analysis, we integrate our shield immunity model into the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis, focusing on susceptible, exposed, and infectious individuals, along with recovered individuals moving freely in a normal scenario. We also consider varying levels of hospitalization for symptomatic cases, including subacute and critical cases requiring ICU intervention, with a significant portion of critical cases resulting in mortality.

The epidemiological parameters, age-stratified risk, and population structure for this model are detailed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, as well as in the code available on GitHub.

Similar to the simple SIR model, shielding has the potential to reduce the burden of the epidemic by decreasing both the total impact and the duration of the peak event. In a population of 10,000,000 for both high and low-transmission scenarios, our model predicts a decrease in deaths with intermediate and enhanced shielding compared to the baseline. Most deaths occur in individuals aged 60 and older, despite their smaller population fraction, consistent with previous COVID-19 models and outbreaks in other countries.\n\nWhile our simulation focuses on the effects of shielding alone, ongoing measures like social distancing and shelter-in-place orders will further reduce interaction rates. The effectiveness of shielding depends on the number of shields identified and their substitutability, as well as demographic distributions, asymptomatic transmission rates, and immunity duration. Populations with a higher proportion of older individuals may benefit more from shielding. Although there are fewer recovered individuals aged 20-60, their contribution to shielding remains important.", "original": "e195534dc5936158ea4196bb28d156c8"}

We estimate that without any interventions, over 14 million people would have died by May 17, 2020, but implementing interventions just a week earlier could have prevented 280,000 deaths globally. Our findings show that restrictions on mass gatherings and school closures led to the greatest reductions in infection rates, at 29.6% and 17.3% respectively. The most effective policy, stay-at-home orders, resulted in an average reduction in infection rates of 74.4% from the baseline for countries that implemented it. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the DELPHI model can forecast future COVID-19 cases under different government policies and highlight how Janssen Pharmaceuticals used this analysis to choose locations for its Phase III trial of the Ad26.Cov2.S vaccine.

(2023) studied the impact of government interventions on forecasting COVID-19 in their research published in the Operations Research journal.

The study showed that the most stringent policy of stay-at-home orders was implemented most widely and resulted in the largest decrease in the residual infection rate compared to less restrictive measures. This highlights the importance of implementing stricter policies later in order to effectively control the spread of the virus.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects.

Policies like stay-at-home orders play a significant role in mitigating the epidemic, despite economic and social costs. Timing of these interventions is crucial in minimizing the total number of cases and deaths. Modeling alternative responses, such as starting mitigation efforts earlier, can show significant reductions in cases and deaths. For example, starting interventions a week earlier in certain countries could have avoided a substantial number of deaths. Additionally, leaving the epidemic unmitigated would have resulted in a much higher death toll globally.", "original": "227fca1544628416933f55e5c822c43b"}

After January 30, however, all regions showed a reproductive number R < 1, indicating the effectiveness of quarantine and control measures in curbing the spread of COVID-19.The confirmation rate of Hubei estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Hubei (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Hubei on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Hubei and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities.

A set of differential equations (Eq.1) is established to model the dynamics of an infectious disease and the control by artificial factors. In the model, individuals can either go directly from U to C, or indirectly through Q. By simplifying the model to Eq. 2, the direct path is eliminated. Biologically meaningful parameters such as the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation (T=1=g1) and the reproductive number of the infection (R=\u03b1=g1) can be defined from the SUQC model. Parameter inference is often based on the number of cumulative confirmed infections, C\u00f0t\u00de, which is the variable with daily observed data for model fitting. The initial values for susceptible individuals S\u00f00\u00de and confirmed infections C\u00f00\u00de are assumed to be the population size and the number of infected individuals obtained from official reports, respectively.

However, in the SUQC model, the precise value of \u03b1 is not crucial as the overall infection ability, measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1, can be adjusted to account for any bias in \u03b1. Other parameters and initial values, such as g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de, and Q\u00f00\u00de, are determined by fitting the daily confirmed infection data to the model.

The lack of data is a significant concern for modelers, as demonstrated by the discrepancy between confirmed cases and model predictions. Confirmed cases only represent a fraction of the total infected population, similar to the tip of an iceberg compared to the entire mass hidden underwater, symbolizing the unknown portion of the epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, it is crucial to estimate key model parameters, such as the transmission rate b, by adjusting the model output to match confirmed cases data. This involves discounting the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), from the model prediction using the case-infection ratio r in order to accurately predict confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, different estimates for the transmission rate b can be determined through fitting the model to data, ultimately impacting the basic reproduction number R0 and other epidemic characteristics such as the peak time. Due to the wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio r in the context of COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary significantly, resulting in a wide range of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, means that multiple combinations of parameters can provide a good match to the data but lead to divergent epidemic forecasts. Addressing nonidentifiability during model calibration is crucial for ensuring the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method, commonly used for optimization in model calibration, may not effectively address nonidentifiability issues due to its basic optimization algorithm. This algorithm attempts to find a global minimum of the objective function but faces challenges when dealing with the numerous global minima present.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

The best-fit values and 95% credible intervals were obtained from these posterior distributions, which can be found in Tables 1 and 2 for the SIR and SEIR models, respectively.\n\nComparing the calibration results for both models, the corrected Akaike Information Criterion AICc values were calculated to be 174 for the SIR model and 186 for the SEIR model. The difference of 12 suggests that using the SEIR model will result in a significant loss of information compared to the SIR model. Therefore, our further investigation will focus on the SIR model.\n\nIn our calibration results for the SIR model, a linkage was identified between the transmission rate (b) and the diagnosis rate (r). The projection of the unnormalized posterior distribution in the b-r parameter space is shown in Fig. 2, illustrating the linkage between these two rates.", "original": "5d8d4c33ff335d6f3a93cfb24aeb378b"}

The duration of symptoms and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients can vary widely, with longer durations often associated with more severe cases. In our model, we account for different recovery times for asymptomatic, mild, and severe cases. Non-critical cases are assumed to recover, while critical cases may either recover or die, with the likelihood of death increasing with age. The transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual comes into contact with an infectious individual, with a probability denoted as \u03b2. In a well-mixed population with an average of 20 contacts per day, a value of \u03b2 = 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of roughly 4-6 days and an R0 of approximately 2.2-2.7, though these values may vary based on population size, age structure, and other factors.

Interventions like physical distancing can alter the value of \u03b2. Individual infectiousness, determined by viral load, can vary among people and over time. We model this variation using two stages of viral load: an initial high stage and a subsequent lower stage. The default viral load is based on a negative binomial distribution with parameters selected to match international estimates and data from specific regions.

These values were selected to align with time-use surveys and previous studies, resulting in a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population.

Interventions such as physical distancing can alter the value of \u03b2. Furthermore, individual differences in disease severity, duration of illness, and infectivity are incorporated into the model by allowing for variations in individual infectiousness over time using viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

Figure 2 displays viral loads for a representative sample of individuals with default parameter values. The distribution of transmissions from asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the situation, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence regarding whether transmissibility is reduced when the infectious individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not reduced, but we offer a parameter that can be adjusted based on the specific modeling application or context. It is worth noting that some studies have suggested much lower rates of infectivity for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e"}
