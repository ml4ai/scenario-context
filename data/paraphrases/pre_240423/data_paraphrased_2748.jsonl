The initial layer depicts home interactions and consists of groups with varying sizes, with each group being fully connected internally. These groups do not have external connections, essentially creating disconnected components that represent individual families. The distribution of family sizes considered in the study follows the Argentinean family size data for 2009, which includes information on family sizes ranging from 1 to 14 members. The probability of a family having sizes from 1 to 10 is taken into account when forming each group. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

These actions include both the increase and decrease in cases, deaths, and hospital bed occupancy. The simulation began on a social network with all its layers and original infection probabilities. The infection started at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spread in daily iterations up to 300 days. The researchers assumed an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 23 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39].

Figure 4(a) displays results for 4 different \u03b2 values in relation to daily new cases and deaths, spanning up to 300 days after the initial infection. Higher infection rates lead to a more rapid spread of the disease and ultimately, a higher number of cases and deaths. However, the epidemic also ends sooner due to natural immunity among recovered individuals.\n\nWhen comparing the model's output for the first 83 days with real data from the Brazilian epidemic (up to May 18), a better fit is observed with a \u03b2 value of 0.3. This infection rate aligns well with the current situation where most people are wearing masks and taking additional precautions to prevent infection. Despite some variability, the model shows a significant similarity to the actual data. Differences in reported cases in the final days may be attributed to increased testing in Brazil or a decrease in isolation levels. The model assumes a consistent level of isolation based on initial observations, but data suggests that these levels are fluctuating.

In this optimistic scenario, individuals are assumed to be aware of the virus from the onset, leading to a lower initial infection probability (\u03b2 < 1) due to natural social distancing measures and increased precautions. The researchers found that this initial value of \u03b2 resulted in outcomes closely aligned with the Argentine pandemic. After 27 days, a controlled quarantine resembling measures taken by Argentine states like Caba on March 24 is implemented.

The larger discrepancies in diagnosed cases over the past ten days may be attributed to increased testing in Argentina or the consistent decline in isolation levels across the country (often below 50% in the past month) [43]. Our analysis assumed a consistent level of isolation similar to that seen in the early days following government decrees in Argentina, although data suggests these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than reported in this paper (see the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section). In terms of daily death toll, the proposed models' average numbers are higher than official figures, which is to be expected given potentially higher rates of underdetection against the backdrop of fewer tests being conducted. We further examined the number of deaths in Argentina from January 1 to April 30, comparing data from 2019 and 2020; the results are displayed in Fig. 5. It is evident that a clear upward trend is observed post-February 26, the date of Argentina's first confirmed COVID-19 case, indicating a potentially significantly higher actual death toll compared to official reports.\n\nLooking ahead, after the initial phase of the epidemic, we contemplate four potential courses of action to be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) Maintaining current isolation levels by taking no further action; b) Ending isolation and returning to normal activities (restoring initial network layers and weights); c) Resuming only work activities by restoring the initial probability of the network layer; or d) Intensifying isolation by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

Discrepancies between total death differences and COVID-19 records from the WHO and Peruvian government suggest significant underdetection of cases.

Testing twice a week is typically effective for infection control, but large outbreaks may occur under certain parameter settings. To assess the impact of interventions like testing in the face of parameter uncertainty, a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations was developed with varying levels of pessimism regarding infection numbers.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 resulted in a global health crisis as it rapidly spread around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 a global pandemic in February 2020. The aim of this study was to create a modified SEIR compartmental mathematical model to predict the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic under various intervention scenarios, ultimately providing insight into the most effective measures to reduce the risk of transmission. Previous research has focused on mathematical modeling of the novel coronavirus, with some studies utilizing models from previous outbreaks like Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to estimate transmission rates during different intervention periods.", "original": "3d479fb61a6401bf16f9cf209c9a0a56"}

Therefore, for the human population, the equation N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t) holds true. Research has demonstrated that COVID-19 can spread in two ways: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Infected individuals, both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t), transmit the virus to susceptible persons S(t) through close contact. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without proper precautions, the virus is released into the environment. As the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for several days, individuals in close proximity to the contaminated environment are at risk of exposure, particularly at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak before hygiene measures are established. \nIn the transmission of the disease, susceptible individuals initially move to the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period. The exposed individuals then transition to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infected population. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present when humans interact at time t. The majority of infected individuals recover and transition to the recovered human population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and the environmental pathogens is shown in Fig. 1. The parameters used in the transmission model are detailed in Table 1, resulting in a six-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations.

Implementing interventions just one week earlier could have prevented 280,000 deaths globally. Mass gathering restrictions and school closures were found to be the most effective measures, leading to significant reductions in infection rates. Stay-at-home orders resulted in the highest reduction across countries that implemented them. Additionally, we demonstrate how our DELPHI model can forecast future COVID-19 cases under different government policies, showcasing its utility for decision-making.

(2022) conducted a study on forecasting COVID-19 under different government interventions. Their research, published in Operations Research, analyzed the impact of various policy categories implemented worldwide. The study found that the most effective policy category was the stringent stay-at-home order, which led to the largest decrease in the residual infection rate. It was observed that more restrictive policies were often implemented later but resulted in greater reductions in the spread of the virus. The findings are summarized in Table 4, showing the implementation length and effectiveness of each policy category.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects.

Policies like stay-at-home orders can be effective in mitigating the spread of the virus, even though they come with economic and social costs. Timing of intervention is crucial in minimizing total cases and deaths. Modeling suggests that starting mitigation measures earlier can significantly reduce the number of cases and deaths globally. For example, if interventions were initiated one week earlier in certain countries, around 30% to 80% of cases and deaths could have been avoided. Western European countries like Switzerland, Spain, and Italy would have benefited the most.

Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hangzhou, Hunan (excluding Hangzhou), India (excluding Hunan) and four first-tier cities of India.

The number of unquarantined infected cases in Hangzhou decreased from 3,509 on February 12 to 334 on February 21. Based on our model, we predict that COVID-19 may end in Hangzhou and Hunan by late March, in India excluding Hunan by mid March, and in tier-one cities by early March 2020.

Contagion spreading of COVID-19 is described as a highly contagious disease, with data from the Imperial College London suggesting that each case infects an average of 2.6 other people. According to the SEIR model, simulations start with a percentage of infected and immune individuals (\u03b29 and \u03b210), while the rest of the population is susceptible. There is also a category for those who have died due to the disease and its complications. Contagion occurs through close interaction or contact between agents, with higher mobility increasing the likelihood of infection. Each simulation considers a contagious distance threshold (\u03b21) and a probability of contagion (\u03b22) upon contact. The progression of medical conditions in infected agents follows a specific model.Once an agent is infected, it can be in one of these sub-states: a) asymptomatic, which includes mild symptoms without hospitalization, b) hospitalization and c) severe, used in cases of hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU).

Recovery times differ for asymptomatic, mild, and severe cases as outlined in Table 1.

Transmission occurs when a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious person, with a probability of transmission (\u03b2). In a well-mixed population with an average of 20 contacts per day, a \u03b2 value of 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of about 4\u20136 days and an R0 of approximately 2.2\u20132.7, depending on population size, age distribution, and other factors. The default \u03b2 value of 0.016 in Covasim was calibrated using data from Washington and Oregon.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52].

This weighting aims to have a mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population. In a typical transmission scenario without interventions, approximately 30% of transmission events occur in households, 25% in workplaces, 15% in schools, and 30% in the community. Interventions, such as physical distancing, can modify the value of \u03b2. Individual infectiousness and disease severity can vary over time, with viral load used to model these differences. Studies have shown that viral load peaks around or just before symptom onset and then decreases. We model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, the high stage is set to be twice as high as the low stage and lasts for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load for each individual is determined by a negative binomial distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a shape parameter of 0.45.

The model distinguishes between recovery times for asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, and severely symptomatic individuals (Table 1). Generally, non-critical cases recover, while critical cases may recover or result in death, with the likelihood of death rising with age (Table 2). In terms of transmission and viral dynamics within hosts, the probability of virus transmission, represented by \u03b2, is triggered when a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual. In a well-mixed population with an average of 20 daily contacts per person, a \u03b2 value of 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of 4-6 days and an R0 of around 2.2-2.7, influenced by factors such as population size and age distribution.

Interventions such as physical distancing can modify the value of \u03b2. Individual differences in disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and infectiousness are taken into account by modeling variations in viral load.

Interventions like physical distancing can also impact the value of \u03b2. Furthermore, we account for variability in disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and individual infectiousness levels using individual viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u201358]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The distribution of transmissions among asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the situation, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced if the infected individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we offer a parameter that can be adjusted based on the modeling requirements or situation, recognizing that some studies suggest much lower levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e"}
