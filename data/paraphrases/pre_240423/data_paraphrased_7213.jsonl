The first layer depicts home interactions, comprised of groups of varying sizes that are internally fully connected. These groups have no external connections, reflecting individual families as disconnected components. The distribution of family sizes in Argentina in 2009 is used to create each group, considering probabilities for family sizes ranging from 1 to 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

The model demonstrates a notable overall similarity within its standard deviation. The increase in diagnosed cases over the past ten days may be attributed to the rise in testing in Argentina, or possibly the consistent decline in isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days in the past month). Our analysis assumed a steady isolation level similar to what was seen in the days following government decrees in Argentina. However, data suggests that these levels are subject to change, potentially resulting in higher numbers of diagnosed cases and deaths than indicated in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). The average daily death toll predicted by the model is higher than the official figures, which is expected due to potential underdetection rates and limited testing.
