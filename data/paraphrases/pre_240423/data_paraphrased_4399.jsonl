The model demonstrates a notable similarity overall within its standard deviation. The recent spike in diagnosed cases in Argentina could be attributed to the increased number of tests being conducted or the consistent drop in isolation levels in the country (which have been below 50% for most days in the past month) [43]. Our analysis assumed a fixed isolation level based on the early days after government mandates in Argentina, but data indicates that these levels are constantly changing. This suggests that the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the simulation may be higher than what is reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). In terms of daily death toll, the average numbers projected by the models are higher than the official figures, possibly due to higher underdetection rates with fewer tests being administered. To further investigate this, we looked at the number of deaths in Argentina from January 1 to April 30, comparing figures from 2019 and 2020; the results are illustrated in Fig. 5. A clear upward trend can be observed after February 26, the day of Argentina's first confirmed COVID-19 case, indicating that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported officially.

The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs", "post_context": ").Furthermore, three additional scenarios were analyzed. One scenario involved the ongoing strict mobility restrictions being permanently in place at a rate of 50%, which was projected to result in the suppression of the epidemic by the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also depicted in Figure 4). The other two scenarios explored the effects of implementing mild restrictions from the outset (25%) or easing restrictions before summer (to 30%), both of which were predicted to lead to a significant increase in the spread of the epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). A screenshot of the model output (Figure 2) illustrates the timeline of a mitigation strategy involving the addition of new hospital beds, a 30-40% reduction in mobility, and testing only severe cases. After one year of simulation, it was projected that there would be 660,000 recovered patients (data not shown). The results presented are based on a single simulation run, not an average of multiple scenarios. Another screenshot of the model output (Figure 3) depicts the timeline of a suppression strategy, which initially involved a 50% reduction in mobility and later a 20-25% reduction, in addition to aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing. By the end of the one-year simulation, it was projected that there would be 77,000 recovered patients (data not shown).

The mean and variance of the prior for each parameter were selected to align with plausible ranges, resulting in a 95% Bayesian credible interval. The choice of a multivariate normal distribution as the prior was necessary for modeling and analysis purposes, as discussed in detail in the SI Appendix. Random parameter sets were then drawn from this Bayesian prior, with feasible values ensured through appropriate truncation for positive and/or bounded parameters. Simulation results formed a prior distribution over infections, addressing parameter uncertainty. While 2\u00d7/wk testing was generally effective for infection control, large outbreaks could occur under certain parameter settings. To better understand the impact of interventions like testing on robustness to parameter uncertainty, a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations was developed with varying levels of pessimism regarding infection numbers. (Methods D and SI Appendix, section 3.A).This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

The pessimistic scenario, compared to the nominal scenario where each parameter is set to the middle of its range, significantly increases the asymptomatic ratio and transmission rate, while decreasing test sensitivity and contact tracing effectiveness. These parameters have the greatest impact on infections. To assess the assumption of linearity in creating these scenarios, we compared the median number of infections under various pessimistic scenarios to the median infections drawn from the prior distribution. The results showed a strong agreement, suggesting that the linearity assumption had minimal impact on the level of pessimism in our scenarios. Simulated infections using 2\u00d7/wk testing across a range of pessimism levels show that testing can keep infections below 1,000 in most parameter configurations. However, in some scenarios, more than 1,000 infections can occur, especially as the parameter configuration becomes more pessimistic. Additional testing can help reduce this risk. When testing frequency is high enough, predicted infections remain low even at high levels of pessimism. Plots of infections versus test frequency and simulation parameters were presented in public reports and at Cornell Faculty Senate meetings.

Due to the diverse mass loss rates and environmental conditions across Antarctic ice shelves, it is essential to dynamically parameterize meltwater settling depth for accurate simulations of high-latitude climate in a warming world.

KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the shortcomings of global coupled climate models included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012) is their inability to retroactively predict key Southern Ocean climate trends, such as surface cooling, surface freshening, and sea ice expansion (Turner et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2016; Kostov et al. 2018). The increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly in recent years may have influenced these observed trends (Rye et al. 2020). Traditionally, climate models have overlooked the abnormal freshwater flux resulting from the net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has escalated to about 500 Gt yr in the past few decades (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019). Recent research indicates that integrating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help elucidate the observed trends and bridge the gap between observations and simulations (Bintanja et al. 2013; Rye et al. 2014; Bintanja et al. 2015; Rye et al. 2020).

Studies have indicated that COVID-19 can spread through human-to-human and environment-to-human transmission. Infected individuals, both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t), can transmit the virus to susceptible persons S(t) through close contact. Additionally, the virus can spread to the environment when infected individuals cough or sneeze without precautions, potentially exposing susceptible individuals in close proximity. Susceptible individuals exposed to the environment may become infected, especially in the early stages of the outbreak before hygiene measures are put in place. The infected individual initially moves to the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period, and then to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) populations.

The table presented in the study ranked the policies based on their estimated effectiveness, showing that more restrictive policies tended to be implemented later but had greater impact on reducing the infection rate compared to less restrictive policies.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects.

Controlling the epidemic requires keeping Rt below 1, or 3.0 if the epidemic is unmitigated at t = 0. This suggests that policy interventions, such as stay-at-home orders, are crucial for reducing the spread of the virus, even though they have significant economic and social consequences. The timing of these interventions plays a crucial role in minimizing the total number of cases and deaths. Modeling different responses, such as starting mitigation measures earlier, can significantly reduce the number of cases and deaths. For example, if interventions had been implemented a week earlier in certain countries, up to 80% of cases and deaths could have been avoided by May 17.

The lack of data is a significant concern for modellers, as the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions can explain the variability in predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals who show symptoms, seek medical attention, get tested, and have their COVID-19 infection confirmed. In transmission models, the infected compartment encompasses all infected individuals, including those with and without symptoms, those who have been tested and confirmed, and those who have been misdiagnosed. Confirmed cases represent only a portion of the total infected population predicted by the model, similar to the tip of an iceberg above the sea surface compared to the entire iceberg below the waterline. The hidden portion of the iceberg symbolizes the unknown infected population not captured by public health surveillance and testing, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, it is essential to adjust the model output to accurately estimate key parameters like the transmission rate (b) by using confirmed cases data. This involves adjusting for the total number of infectious individuals (I\u00f0t\u00de) by applying the case-infection ratio (r) in order to make accurate predictions. Different values of r can lead to a wide range of estimated transmission rates for COVID-19, resulting in a wide range of model predictions that could affect the scale of the epidemic and peak time. This issue, known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, highlights the challenge of determining unique model parameters from the data. Different parameter combinations that fit the data well may result in drastically different model predictions. How nonidentifiability is handled in the model calibration process plays a crucial role in the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method may not effectively address this issue due to its basic optimization algorithm, which attempts to find a global minimum of the objective function but may encounter multiple global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Infectious individuals can vary in disease severity, time spent in each state, and level of infectiousness, which is modeled based on individual viral load.

Our model accounts for this by representing two stages of viral load: an initial high stage followed by a longer low stage.
