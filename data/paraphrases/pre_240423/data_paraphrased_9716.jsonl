In an optimistic scenario where individuals are aware of the virus from the outset, the initial infection probability was set to \u03b2 < 1.This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic.

Comparing our model's output with real data from the Brazilian epidemic up to May 18, we see in Fig. 4(b) that a \u03b2 value of 0.3 provides a good fit.
