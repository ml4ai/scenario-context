In the model, t0 signifies the number of days after the first case when mask wearing is mandated. For instance, in the case of Malaysia, t0 is set to 89 days since compulsory mask wearing was implemented 89 days after the first case. This model is applied to both Scenarios 1 and 3. A modification to Equation (9) accounts for gradual noncompliance with mask wearing, adding another variable \u03b2nc to represent the increased infection rate due to noncompliance. This gradual increase in infection rate due to noncompliance contrasts with the immediate decrease seen in infection rates when mask wearing is enforced. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2.

The mean and variance of the prior for each parameter were selected to align with credible intervals and plausible ranges.

Random parameter sets were drawn from this prior distribution, with adjustments made for parameters that needed to be positive or bounded. Simulations were run using this prior distribution to account for parameter uncertainty. Testing twice a week was found to be effective in controlling infections in most scenarios, but large outbreaks could occur under certain parameter settings. To analyze the impact of interventions like testing on robustness in the face of parameter uncertainty, a parameter configuration approach was developed.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

Our assumption of linearity when creating these scenarios had minimal impact on their level of pessimism, as demonstrated in our comparison of infections under different scenarios.

KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change\n\nIntroduction\nGlobal coupled climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012) have struggled to replicate key Southern Ocean climate trends, including surface cooling, freshening, and sea ice expansion (Turner et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2016; Kostov et al. 2018). The increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly may have contributed to these trends (Rye et al. 2020). Climate models often overlook the freshwater flux from Antarctic ice sheet mass loss, which has been rising to approximately 500 Gt yr in recent decades (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019). Recent studies propose that incorporating this meltwater anomaly into climate models could reconcile observed trends with simulations, addressing the discrepancy (Bintanja et al. 2013; Rye et al. 2014; Bintanja et al. 2015; Rye et al. 2020).

Therefore, for the human population, we have N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Research has shown that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in two ways: human to human and environment to human. Both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) infected individuals can spread the virus to susceptible persons S(t) they come into close contact with. Additionally, when infected individuals cough or sneeze without taking precautions, the virus can spread to the surrounding environment. As the pathogen P(t) can survive in the environment for several days, individuals in close contact with this environment are at risk of being exposed to the virus, especially in the early stages of the outbreak. In the transmission of the disease, susceptible individuals first move to the exposed population E(t) due to the incubation period. The exposed individuals then progress to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious populations. P(t) represents the quantity of pathogens present during human interactions at time t. Most infectious individuals recover and become part of the recovered human population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment is shown in Fig. 1.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Implementing widespread serological testing programs is crucial for taking proactive measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate economic recovery, resulting in fewer than 25% of the population being infected, as opposed to the estimated 90% in the absence of protective measures. Our core shielding model serves as the foundation for our approach to COVID-19, capturing the conservative advantages of shielding.

In this study, we apply our shield immunity model to the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis. For simplicity, we do not account for births or other mortality factors. Our model involves a population categorized into susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatically infectious (Ia), symptomatically infectious (Is), and recovered individuals (R) who can move freely in a scenario resembling 'business as usual'.

More stringent policies, although implemented later, were associated with greater reductions in the residual infection rate compared to less restrictive measures.This is expected, because during the first wave the \u03b3(t) function is monotonically decreasing ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0), and later-implemented policies will have larger estimated effects.

Implementing policies like stay-at-home orders can help mitigate the epidemic, even though they come with economic and social costs. Timing is crucial in reducing the total number of cases and deaths. Modeling shows that starting mitigation efforts earlier can significantly reduce the percentage of cases and deaths. For example, if interventions were initiated just one week earlier in certain countries, approximately 30% to 80% of deaths could have been avoided.

To analyze these dynamics, we have developed a Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model, which explicitly considers the intervention effects of control measures. This model is more appropriate for studying COVID-19 compared to other existing epidemic models.Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangzhou, Guangdong (excluding Guangzhou), China (excluding Guangdong) and four first-tier cities of China.

These social constructs and periodic routines are hardcoded but can be adjusted by users for flexibility. The parameter set can be modified to represent anything from a single community to an entire country. The experimental methodology for evaluating this approach involved creating seven different scenarios reflecting various social distancing interventions.

However, the lack of data poses a more significant issue for modellers. A crucial factor that may contribute to variations in model predictions is understanding how the available data of confirmed cases aligns with model projections. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have sought medical attention, undergone testing, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed through DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all infected individuals, including those with or without symptoms, individuals in contact with medical facilities, and individuals with confirmed tests as well as those who may have been misdiagnosed. Therefore, confirmed cases (data) represent only a portion of the total infected population (model predictions). A useful metaphor to illustrate this concept is that of an iceberg. The entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, with the visible tip above the water surface representing the case data. The submerged portion of the iceberg represents the infected individuals not captured by public health surveillance or testing, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021).\n\nWhy might this pose a challenge for modelers? When calibrating a model, it is necessary to adjust key parameters like the transmission rate b by considering the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), and the case-infection ratio r in order to accurately predict confirmed case data. This process allows for the estimation of the transmission rate b and the basic reproduction number R 0, as well as the scale and timing of an epidemic. Due to the wide range of potential case-infection ratios for COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary widely, leading to a range of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in modeling, poses a challenge as different combinations of parameters can provide good fits to the data but result in vastly different predictions. This issue can impact the reliability of model predictions, particularly if standard methods like nonlinear least squares are used, as they may not effectively address nonidentifiability due to their basic optimization algorithms. These algorithms aim to find a global minimum for the objective function, but the presence of multiple global minima can complicate this process.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Transmission of the virus occurs with a probability \u03b2 whenever a susceptible individual encounters an infectious individual.

Interventions, such as physical distancing, can impact the value of \u03b2. Individual infectiousness can vary based on factors such as disease severity and time spent in each disease state.
