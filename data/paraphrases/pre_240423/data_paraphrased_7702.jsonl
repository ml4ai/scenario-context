Scabini, L.C. Ribas, M.B. Neiva, and colleagues, a multi-layer network is proposed to model social interactions. In the network, each social layer represents different types of interactions among people, with nodes representing individuals that remain constant across layers. The connections between nodes are weighted to represent social contact, with the edge weight indicating the probability of infection transmission (ranging from 0 to 1).\n\nThe first layer of the network depicts interactions within homes, where nodes are grouped into various sizes of fully connected groups. These groups do not have external connections, reflecting disconnected components representing individual families. The distribution of family sizes is based on data from the Peruvian census in 2009, with probabilities assigned to family sizes ranging from 1 to 10 members. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1. The first layer is then created following the family size distribution and ensuring that each family has at least one adult.

A significant portion of the population in any country engages in some form of economic activity, requiring interactions with others. Therefore, work plays a vital role in social relations, especially during an epidemic. To model work activity, we suggest a generic layer connecting individuals aged 18 to 59, encompassing 60% of Peru's total population. Given the diversity of jobs and companies, establishing a connection rule that accurately reflects the real world is complex. We propose a scenario with random groups ranging from 5 to 30 individuals, uniformly distributed and internally connected, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b) for n = 100. The transmission of viruses within these groups depends on edge weights, discussed further in Section 3.1.1.\n\nPublic transportation is crucial in most cities, serving as a densely populated environment that facilitates geographical spread during an epidemic. A third layer in our model represents public transport users, accounting for approximately 50% of the population, randomly sampled from varying group sizes between 10 and 40 individuals. This layer is significant in cities across Peru, with 64.98% of individuals in capitals and 35.89% in other urban areas utilizing public transport, averaging about 1.2 hours of usage daily.", "original": "43497a975dec6998de7cf3e8e7a0fa4d"}

The simulation starts with a social network with all its layers and original infection probabilities. The infection initiates at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spreads over iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). In an optimistic scenario where individuals are aware of the virus from the start, the initial infection probability is set at \u03b2 < 1. This reflects natural social distancing measures and precautions to prevent infection. The study found that this initial \u03b2 value correlates well with the Peruvian pandemic. A controlled quarantine is introduced after 27 days, mirroring the isolation measures adopted by most Peruvian states on March 24. During this quarantine, certain layers such as religious activities and schools are removed, and contacts in transports and work settings are reduced to 30% of their initial levels (\u03b2 = 0.09). Activities that must continue are those deemed essential, with heightened precautionary measures in place. The impact of varying the \u03b2 parameter on the epidemic curve is analyzed, with results showing that higher infection rates lead to faster disease spread and more cases and deaths, but also a quicker end to the epidemic due to natural immunization of recovered individuals.4.1.

The notable increase in diagnosed cases in the last ten days could be attributed to the rise in testing in Peru. Alternatively, it could be linked to the consistent decrease in isolation levels in the country, which have been below 50% for most days in the past month. We have assumed a fixed isolation level based on the early days following government decrees in Peru. However, data from the same source indicates that these levels are subject to change. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may exceed those reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section).\n\nIn terms of daily death toll, the average number projected by our models is higher than the official figures. This discrepancy is expected due to potential underdetection rates exacerbated by a lower number of tests being conducted. To further explore this issue, we examined the number of deaths in Peru from January 1 to April 30, comparing data from 2019 and 2020; the findings are illustrated in Figure 5. A clear upward trend is evident after February 26, the date of Peru's first confirmed case of COVID-19, suggesting that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported figures.\n\nLooking ahead, we have identified four potential actions to be considered after 90 days (May 26) following the initial phase of the epidemic:\na) Maintain current isolation levels without any additional measures;\nb) End isolation and resume normal activities, restoring initial network layers and weights;\nc) Resume only work-related activities, reinstating the initial layer's probability;\nd) Enhance isolation by halting all remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312"}

Analysis of Delay in Mandating Masks\n\nBy utilizing SEIR models in the three scenarios outlined above, we were able to determine the Maximum Infected Values by simulating various delays in the enforcement of mask wearing. In Scenario 1, where there is full compliance with mask wearing and no time-limited immunity, Figure 3 illustrates the impact of enforcing masks on different timelines: (a) the day the first COVID-19 case was detected in Malaysia; (b) after a 50-day delay; (c) after a 100-day delay; and (d) no enforcement at all.\n\nIt is evident from Figure 3 that implementing mask wearing earlier reduces the Maximum Infected Value and delays reaching this peak value. The peak of the infected curve shifts to the right with earlier enforcement, while the overall maximum value decreases. The number of infections rises until it reaches the global peak, before declining as per compartmental modeling predictions. \n\nFor instance, with no delay in mask enforcement (a), the maximum infected value is around 10.453%, peaking on day 291. With a 50-day delay (b), the maximum infected value is approximately 10.479%, peaking on day 195. However, a 100-day delay (c) results in a much higher maximum infected value of around 27.474%, peaking on day 103, similar to the scenario with no enforcement (d).", "original": "b6d74dfbedfa805b659e1d543d58ea0a"}

It is known that there is variability in estimating the basic reproduction number, and there is a lack of standardized methods for calculating and reporting it. In the early stages of an epidemic, small datasets/time-points are used, leading to missing crucial information. Data quality, accuracy, and reliability improve over time. Estimates depend heavily on the specific datasets used, and revising/updating them could impact results. Clinical parameters can be inferred from relevant clinical data, and the possibility of infection spread from asymptomatic cases was recently discovered. A high reproduction number indicates the potential for a serious epidemic without prompt public health interventions during times of high social contact. The serial interval directly affects the accuracy of likelihood function estimation. The incubation period for Nanjing patients with coronavirus pneumonia is approximately 2 to 15 days, according to current findings. We then assume that the serial interval follows the gamma distribution with varying mean and variance, which allows us to examine the influence on the reproduction number. With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation.

Achieving this high threshold rate of quarantine requires a robust public health infrastructure and strict adherence to personal protective measures. This includes reducing transmission-effective contacts, implementing separation and restrictions during quarantine. Such stringent measures are only feasible when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, emphasizing the importance of travel restrictions.

The mean and variance of the prior for each parameter were selected to create a symmetric 95% Bayesian credible interval that aligned with the plausible ranges set for each parameter. To ensure ease of analysis, we opted for a multivariate normal distribution as the prior, which met both modeling and tractability requirements. We generated random parameter sets from this Bayesian prior, adjusting for feasibility constraints on positive and bounded parameters. By simulating infections for each set of parameters, we constructed a prior distribution that accounted for parameter uncertainty. Our results suggest that 2\u00d7/wk testing is generally effective for infection control, but large outbreaks can occur under specific parameter settings. To explore the impact of interventions like testing on robustness to parameter uncertainty, we created a one-dimensional array of parameter configurations varying in pessimism regarding infection levels.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

By June 2021, only 37% of Ontario residents will be susceptible to the virus. The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2021 and then sees a higher peak in the spring, mainly driven by the wild-type and Alpha variants. The proportion of infections attributed to the Alpha variant decreases as vaccination rates rise. The majority of infections are split evenly between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, with most occurring in unvaccinated individuals. The recovered population is expected to reach 7% by the end of 2021.These dynamics are summarized as fractions of the population that are susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered, as shown in Fig. 3i.

We observed that the", "post_context": ", therefore while the epidemics will continue to grow, the epidemic will peak soon.Accurately forecasting the trend of the epidemic and predicting its peak time requires real-time data and knowledge of how to implement and utilize available resources to support major public health interventions, beyond just policy and decision-making.

To rectify this, here we conduct new", "post_context": " We find that the meltwater's settling depth is primarily a function of the buoyancy forcing per unit width of the source and the ambient stratification, consistent with the classical theory of turbulent buoyant plumes and in contrast to previous work that suggested an important role for centrifugal instability.Our findings emphasize the important role of localized variability in stratification, which helps to account for the variability in vertical meltwater distribution near Pine Island Glacier. Given the diverse mass loss rates and different conditions across Antarctic ice shelves, a dynamic parameterization of meltwater settling depth is essential for accurately simulating high-latitude climate in a warming world. We discuss the potential development of this parameterization following our research, as well as the remaining challenges. KEYWORDS: Ocean; Antarctica; Glaciers; Snowmelt/icemelt; Climate change\n\nIntroduction:\nGlobal coupled climate models in the CMIP5 project have failed to accurately replicate important Southern Ocean climate trends, such as surface cooling, freshening, and sea ice expansion. The increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly over time may have contributed to these observed trends. Climate models typically overlook the anomalous freshwater flux resulting from net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, which has been increasing in recent decades. Recent studies suggest that incorporating this meltwater anomaly in climate models could help explain observed trends and bridge the gap between observations and simulations. The inclusion of Antarctic glacial meltwater in climate models has significant implications.", "original": "13f74d2d3013a43c137123635c3f282b"}

The pathogen can survive in the environment for a period of time, potentially exposing susceptible individuals to the virus, particularly in the early stages of the outbreak. The model involves the movement of individuals from susceptible to exposed to infectious populations, with the majority ultimately recovering and moving to the recovered population.

This results in increased transmission of COVID-19 in various settings such as households, workplaces, schools, through foodstuffs, and during commutes. As a result, there is a surge in virus cases in environments like workplaces, schools, food facilities, and public transport, as shown in Figure 2b, leading to a rise in confirmed coronavirus cases, depicted in Figure 2a within a span of 10 to 35 days.\n\nIn this model, the constants \u03b11 and \u03b12 are considered inversely proportional to the frequency at which individuals acquire COVID-19 from the environment and infected individuals, respectively. Figure 2 illustrates that when \u03b11 = 0.05, indicating a high risk of infection from a contaminated environment compared to an infected individual, there is an increase in exposed, asymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Conversely, when \u03b12 = 0.05, suggesting a higher chance of infection from an individual rather than a contaminated environment, the number of exposed individuals declines. Additionally, in Figure 2c, the susceptible population diminishes by the 23rd day for \u03b12 = 0.05 due to rapid infection spread, as shown in Figure 2d-f for the initial 20-day period.Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for \u03b12 = 0.05 , as compared to when \u03b11 = 0.05 and \u03b12 = 0.1.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

However, more detailed mixing and substitution models could potentially create different versions of this model, especially in spatially explicit regions or on networks. In this study, we use our shield immunity model to analyze the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, excluding factors like births and other causes of death for simplicity. The model considers various categories of individuals - susceptible, exposed, infectious asymptomatically, infectious symptomatically, and recovered - who are able to move freely in a scenario resembling normalcy. Some symptomatic cases may require hospitalization, divided into subcategories of subacute and critical/acute cases. Based on age-stratified risk data, the model incorporates shield immunity to reduce transmission rates, factoring in the fraction of the population in the circulating baseline and the number of recovered individuals within a specific age group. The assumption is that all recovered individuals have immunity, but only a subset can contribute to interaction substitutions.

During this time interval, confirmed infection numbers may provide a less biased representation of the natural characteristics of COVID-19. Before January 15, confirmed numbers were small and fluctuating, influenced by strict quarantine measures in later stages. The parameter \u03b1 is challenging to accurately estimate, with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 using different methods or data sets. Fortunately, an exact value of \u03b1 is not crucial in the SUQC model, as the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1 is sensitive in parameter optimization. The bias of \u03b1 can be offset by g1. Other free parameters and initial values, including g1, \u03b2, U(0), and Q(0), are estimated by fitting daily confirmed infection time series to the model. The expected daily time series of confirmed infections (^C) provided by the model is determined using given parameter values and solved by the Runge-Kutta method. The loss function is optimized using the interior point method in MATLAB's fmincon function to infer parameter values. Different initial values are attempted in parameter optimization, showing that inferred values are not sensitive to initial values. Weighted loss functions are considered to better integrate information throughout the epidemic.", "original": "da36c1f3037e4009701d4b09b0a6c11a"}

The research focuses on agent-based simulation and epidemic models like SEIR in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non- pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pan- demic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation.", "post_context": " The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a mul- titude of other scenarios.Hence, it serves as a valuable tool for policymakers and health authorities in strategizing their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30th, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11th. In Brazil, the first confirmed case was reported on February 25th, 2020, and the country has since been significantly impacted by the virus. As of June 26th, 2020, Brazil had over 1,220,000 confirmed cases and more than 55,000 deaths due to COVID-19. The pandemic has not only affected public health but also various other aspects of society, including politics, education, economy, social life, environment, and climate. Implementing strict social distancing measures on the population is considered the most effective way to combat the spread of the disease, as indicated by several studies and reviews. Different countries are adopting such measures with varying levels of success, but due to the complexity of societies, predicting the exact outcome is challenging.", "original": "2cd6401319e011014bde1adbb24c9c21"}

However, the lack of data is a major concern for modellers. A crucial factor influencing model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) aligns with the model's projections. Confirmed cases refer to individuals displaying symptoms who sought medical attention, got tested, and received confirmation of a COVID-19 infection through tests. The infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all infected individuals, including those with or without symptoms, those who interacted with healthcare facilities, individuals confirmed by tests, and misdiagnosed cases. Thus, the confirmed cases (data) only represent a portion of the total infected population (model predictions). An apt metaphor for this discrepancy is an iceberg, where the entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, the part above the water's surface represents the confirmed cases, and the submerged portion signifies the unseen infected individuals not captured by public health surveillance and testing - commonly referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

When calibrating a model to estimate important parameters like the transmission rate b, it is essential to adjust the model prediction by discounting the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), by a case-infection ratio r in order to accurately predict confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, different estimates for the transmission rate b can be determined, ultimately impacting the basic reproduction number R 0 and the timing of the epidemic peak. The wide range of potential values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19 results in a wide range of estimated transmission rates b, leading to a wide range of model predictions. This variability in parameter values, known as nonidentifiability, can create significant differences in model predictions despite fitting the data well. The way in which nonidentifiability is addressed during the model calibration process significantly affects the reliability of model predictions. Standard nonlinear least squares methods are ineffective in addressing nonidentifiability, as they utilize basic optimization algorithms that may not accurately identify the best parameter values.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}
