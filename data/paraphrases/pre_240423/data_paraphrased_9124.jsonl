The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs", "post_context": ").Furthermore, three additional scenarios were analyzed. One scenario assessed the potential outcomes of maintaining the current strict mobility restrictions at 50%, resulting in a projected suppression of the epidemic by the end of 2020. Two other scenarios examined the impact of starting with mild restrictions at 25% or relaxing restrictions before summer to 30%, both scenarios indicating a rapid increase in the epidemic. The model output on the timeline of a mitigation strategy, involving the addition of new hospital beds, a 30-40% mobility restriction, and testing only severe cases, showed 660,000 recovered patients after a one-year simulation. Similarly, the model output on the timeline of a suppression strategy, with an initial 50% mobility reduction and later 20-25% reduction, along with aggressive testing of mild cases and contact tracing, showed 77,000 recovered patients after one year. These results represent individual simulation runs, rather than an average of multiple runs. (Tuomisto et al.

The mean and variance were chosen to create a symmetric 95% Bayesian credible interval aligned with plausible ranges for each parameter. We opted for a multivariate normal distribution as a prior due to modeling and tractability considerations. This allowed us to have a unimodal prior with ellipsoidal contours for the subsequent analysis. Random sets of parameters were drawn from this Bayesian prior, trimmed to ensure feasible values, and used to create a prior distribution accounting for parameter uncertainty in infections. Testing twice a week is generally effective for infection control, but some parameter settings may lead to large outbreaks. To assess the impact of interventions such as testing on robustness to parameter uncertainty, we developed a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with varying levels of pessimism about infection numbers.This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model.

These parameters have the greatest impact on infections, which is illustrated in Figure 2A and further visualized in SI Appendix, Fig. S15. To assess the impact of the linear assumption used in creating these scenarios, we analyzed the median number of infections under various pessimistic scenarios compared to the q quantile of median infections drawn from the prior distribution. The results showed strong agreement, indicating that the linearity assumption minimally affected the level of pessimism in our scenarios. We then conducted simulations using biweekly testing at different levels of pessimism (Fig. 2C with test frequency multiplier = 1.0; Fig. 3C). This frequency of testing effectively kept infections below 1,000 in most scenarios, although in some cases infections exceeded this threshold and increased rapidly with higher levels of pessimism. Additional testing can help mitigate this risk (Fig. 2D). Higher test frequency can keep predicted infections low even at very pessimistic levels.

Research has shown that COVID-19 can be transmitted through two means: from human to human and from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic (IA(t)) and symptomatic (IS(t)) infected individuals are capable of spreading the virus to susceptible individuals (S(t)) they come into close contact with, as well as contaminating their surroundings through sneezing or coughing. This increases the risk of exposure to the pathogen, especially in the early stages of the outbreak before proper hygiene measures are put in place. Susceptible individuals initially move to the exposed population (E(t)), followed by either asymptomatic or symptomatic infection. The model illustrates the interaction between the human population and pathogens in the environment.

Complementary to mitigation and suppression, we have proposed a 'shield immunity' model of intervention that leverages serological tests to identify and deploy recovered individuals who have developed protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2.

Implementing large-scale serological testing initiatives is crucial in taking proactive steps to end the pandemic and reopen the economy, potentially limiting infections to less than 25% of the population instead of the expected 90% without any measures. Our shielding model serves as a foundation for applying these concepts to COVID-19, with room for further variations in models based on different factors. By focusing on shield immunity in our epidemiological analysis, we simplify the scenario by excluding factors like births and other causes of death. We consider a population consisting of susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and recovered individuals, with a subset of symptomatic cases needing hospitalization.

We developed DELPHI, a novel epidemiological model for predicting detected cases and deaths in the prevaccination era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model allows for underdetection of infections and effects of government interventions.", "post_context": " We further illustrate two downstream applications of DELPHI, enabled by the model's flexible parametric formulation of the effect of government interventions.We first analyze the impact of government interventions on the spread of the pandemic. Our predictions show that without any interventions, more than 14 million people would have died by May 17, 2020. Implementing interventions just one week earlier could have prevented 280,000 deaths worldwide. Mass gathering restrictions and school closings resulted in the largest reductions in infection rates, with decreases of 29.6% and 17.3% respectively. Stay-at-home orders had the most significant impact, reducing infection rates by an average of 74.4% across countries that implemented them. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model, DELPHI, can forecast future COVID-19 cases under different governmental policies. Janssen Pharmaceuticals used our analyses to select trial locations for their vaccine candidate, Ad26.Cov2.S. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been the deadliest in recent history, with over 530 million confirmed cases and 6.3 million deaths as of June 1st, 2022. DELPHI, developed in late March 2020, is an epidemiological model that extends the classic SEIR model to predict the pandemic's evolution, including deaths and accounting for underdetection of infections. This model has been consistently used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for forecasting. Additional information can be found in the e-companion available at the provided link.

Timing is crucial when implementing these measures to minimize the total number of cases and deaths.

This disease showcases unique characteristics, such as high infectivity during the incubation period, delays between actual dynamics and reported cases, and the impact of quarantine and control measures.\n\nApproach: A Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model was created to analyze the dynamics of COVID-19, incorporating the effects of intervention measures. This model is more suitable for studying this epidemic compared to others.\n\nFindings: By applying the SUQC model to daily data on confirmed cases in various regions of China, including Wuhan, Hunan, and major cities, it was discovered that most regions had a reproductive number (R) greater than 1 before January 30, 2020. However, after this date, all regions had an R value less than 1, indicating that the implemented quarantine and control measures were successful in curbing the spread of COVID-19.

To better understand these dynamics, we have developed a Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model. This model allows us to analyze the impact of control measures on the spread of COVID-19, providing valuable insights into the outbreak.

While lack of data is a serious concern for modellers, a key factor influencing model predictions is the comparison of available data (confirmed cases) with model forecasts. Confirmed cases represent people with symptoms who have been tested and diagnosed with COVID-19, while the infected compartment in transmission models includes all infected individuals, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, confirmed by lab tests or misdiagnosed. This discrepancy is akin to an iceberg, with confirmed cases being the tip visible above the water's surface, while the larger portion hidden below represents individuals unrecognized by testing and surveillance, known as the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

When calibrating a model to estimate transmission rates such as b, it is important to adjust for the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), by using the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed case data. The transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data for different values of r, which affects other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0 and the timing of the epidemic peak. However, due to the wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary greatly, leading to a wide range of model predictions. This nonidentifiability, or the inability to uniquely determine model parameters from given data, can result in diverse model predictions even when parameters have a good fit to the data. Proper addressing of nonidentifiability during model calibration is crucial for reliable predictions, as standard methods like nonlinear least squares may not effectively handle this issue.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b"}

Our model, Covasim, accounts for this by assigning different recovery times for asymptomatic cases, mild cases, and severe cases, as detailed in Table 1. Non-critical cases are assumed to recover, while critical cases may recover or result in death, with the likelihood of death rising with age (Table 2). Transmission of the virus occurs when a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual, with a probability denoted as \u03b2.

The current default \u03b2 value in Covasim, 0.016, was determined through data analysis from Washington and Oregon states.However, this default value is too low for high-transmission contexts such as New York City or Lombardy [51], and may be too high for low-transmission contexts such as India's first wave [52].

Interventions like physical distancing can alter the transmission rate (\u03b2). Individual infectiousness is allowed to vary based on factors such as disease severity and viral load. We model viral load in two stages: an initial high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, viral load is highest just before symptoms appear and decreases over time.

The default transmission probabilities are approximately 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community.

The value of \u03b2 can also be impacted by interventions like physical distancing. Additionally, individual infectiousness and disease severity can vary, as well as changes in infectivity over time, which are modeled using individual viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The distribution of transmissions among asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies depending on the context, with estimated proportions for Portland provided in [25]. There is uncertainty regarding whether the transmissibility is reduced if the infected individual does not display symptoms [55].
