The initial infection occurred at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spread over iterations of 1 day for up to 300 days. The researchers considered an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1. This scenario mimicked natural social distancing practices and precautionary measures. The study found that this initial \u03b2 value provided results that closely mirrored the Argentine pandemic.\n\nAfter 27 days, a moderate quarantine was implemented to simulate the isolation measures put in place by most Argentine states on March 24, such as Buenos Aires. This quarantine involved removing layers related to religious activities and schools, as well as reducing transport and workplace contacts to 30% of their original values, corresponding to \u03b2 = 0.09. Some essential services and activities continued with higher precautionary measures, potentially leading to violation of the quarantine. The researchers first examined how the \u03b2 parameter influenced the overall shape of the epidemic. Results showed that higher infection rates led to faster disease spread and higher case and death numbers, but also resulted in quicker epidemic resolution due to natural immunization of recovered individuals.4.1.

We used a constant isolation level similar to that observed in the early days following government decrees in Argentina, although data indicates these levels are fluctuating. This suggests that the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than reported in this paper (refer to the 'keep isolation' scenario in the next section). On the topic of daily death tolls, the average number projected by our models surpasses official figures, likely due to higher underdetection rates in conjunction with fewer tests being conducted. An analysis comparing deaths in Argentina between January 1 and April 30 from 2019 and 2020 revealed a marked increase in deaths after February 26, the date of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Argentina, indicating the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported numbers. Looking ahead, we outline four potential actions to be taken after the initial epidemic phase, 90 days in (May 26): a) maintain current isolation levels; b) lift isolation measures and return to normal activities; c) resume only work-related activities; or d) intensify isolation by halting work and transportation activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312", "original_pre_context": "eiva et al.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2.

[3] implemented a compartmentalized models for their simulations, and concluded that if the population remains unmasked until mask enforcement after some discrete delay, and that the level of adoption is fixed, the delay initially had little impact on the hospitalized fraction or deaths, but states that a 'point of no return' can be crossed. While this study yields similar results to ours, it is contextualised in the US states of New York and Washington, whilst ours was conducted in the context of Singapore.

Furthermore, this study did not take into consideration newer, more infectious strains of the virus such as the B117 variant and time-limited immunity, which we have considered in our study.

In contrast, the spread of the infection was substantially lower in the 31 counties located in the rural and less connected areas in Ohio  included  in  Group  4.  Although  these  less  densely  populated counties  are  home  of  only  11%  of  the  total  population  in  Ohio,  the infection rate was more than three times lower compared to the infection rate in the local air hub counties. We also identified marked differences in the geographical distribution of the critical healthcare capacity of the state. More than 50% of the total number of ICU beds available are in the five counties included in Group 1 with a rate of 22 ICU beds per 100,000 people. In contrast, only 7% of the total number of ICU beds available in the state are distributed in the 31 counties located in the rural and less connected areas of the state, with a ", "original_post_context": ". Despite these local differences in the critical healthcare capacity of the state, our modeling results suggest that the differential local dynamics of the disease, with substantially  less  transmission  in  these  rural  and  less  connected counties, prevented the saturation of the critical care response in these areas.  We  found  that  if  the  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  implemented in the state in mid-March 2020 were maintained after early May, only 27% of the maximum critical care capacity of the state would be reached, and along with the 10 counties that do not have hospitals with ICU  beds.  Three  more  counties,  Clermont,  Delaware,  and  Lawrence would  reach  more  than  50%  of  their  maximum  critical  care  capacity under  this  scenario.  In  contrast,  our  predictions  indicated  that  if  the intervention is eased by 50%, an estimated 61% of the maximum critical healthcare capacity of the state would be reached eight weeks after the relaxation  of  the  intervention.  However,  areas  with  more  intense transmission of the disease (Group 1) would experience a faster saturation  of  the  critical  care  capacity.  Although  these  counties  had  the highest critical healthcare capacity, the faster and more intense spread of the epidemic experienced in these areas would substantially impact the critical care response in these counties. As a result, the healthcare capacity in these counties would be almost completely saturated (94% of the  maximum  capacity)  eight  weeks  after  the  social  distancing  intervention is eased.

We began by elevating transmission rates in our model by a factor of 2.5 to account for the Delta variant. We added parameters to account for the effectiveness of vaccines against 1) transmission and 2) susceptibility to infection. We modeled 95% of the Cornell student population as vaccinated, a level that was later exceeded once newly arriving international students were vaccinated. Significant changes had occurred since previous semesters: Social distancing restrictions had been lifted, prevalence outside the campus had changed, contact tracing faced a larger number of contacts per trace (meaning less attention can be paid to each contact), and asymptomatic vaccinated close contacts were no longer required to quarantine. This created uncertainty in several parameters: transmission rates within and from outside campus, and the number of cases quarantined or isolated per initiated contact trace. We placed a (joint) prior on these parameters, sampled parameters from that prior, ran simulations at each parameter set, and updated the prior to a posterior; see Methods F and SI Appendix, section 4.

Because COVID-19 mortality rate can vary substantially depending on health care infrastructure, we varied \u03bcW I by 50%. As expected, changes in \u03bcW I are immediately reflected in the number of deaths. However, compared to other clinical features of SARS- CoV-2, the mortality rate has a relatively small effect on the infected population, since < 5% of them die (Fig. 4). Provincial policy and pharmaceutical interventions that were considered include NPI that reduce the effective disease infectivity (via scaling by \u03bb), vaccination rate (\u03c91), delay between the first and second vaccine doses (\u03c92,PZ and \u03c92,AZ, varied simultaneously), and ", "post_context": " \u03bb and \u03c91 are varied by 5%. Given that Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) have a significant impact on model predictions by directly scaling \u03b2W, their effects are large, as shown in Figure 4. The vaccination rate also plays a role in controlling the spread of the disease, albeit to a lesser extent. On the other hand, the dosing interval (\u03c92) and vaccine escape rate (\u03b2W V) have minimal effects. To account for variability in dosing intervals within the population and the lack of precise characterization of vaccine escape rates, these two parameters were adjusted by 50%. The results related to vaccines suggest that effective deployment of a vaccine (as captured in \u03c91) is crucial in combating a pandemic, and success can be achieved even with a vaccine that has a higher escape rate. Given that variations in \u03c91 have a more significant impact on predicted infections and deaths compared to variations in \u03c92, it may be advisable to prioritize the first vaccine dose by extending the dosing interval, as seen in Canada. In a subsequent sensitivity analysis, the full model incorporating all three variants was considered using baseline parameter values. Key parameters were increased to assess their effects on infections and deaths related to each variant. In addition to the parameters analyzed earlier, additional parameters related to interactions between Variants of Concern (VOC) were considered, such as the rate of infection of individuals with partial immunity from recovering from a different variant (\u03b2X R) and the rate of loss of immunity due to infection (\u03b7R).

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. Conclusions: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.

Han-kou's local medical agency implemented clinical diagnosis as an added criterion after February 14, leading to a surge in confirmed infections. However, a portion of total infected cases still remain undetected even with clinical diagnosis. Using the inferred parameters, we projected long-term predictions for total infected, unquarantined infected, quarantined infected, and cumulative confirmed infections in Han-kou (Figure 1A). The model predicts that the epidemic will last for 147 days from January 28, 2020, with a total of 62,577 infected individuals. Analyzing stage I data from Han-kou provides insights into the epidemic trend assuming minimal quarantine and control measures. The first 10 daily data points were used to calculate the parameters, while the remaining data points validated the model's performance (Figure 1C, D). The model predicts a significant increase in confirmed infections and total infections, exceeding observed numbers after January 21. The number of total infected can be as large as 8,923,823, and the epidemic lasts for a much longer time (328 days, see Table 1). The dramatic difference between predictions from stage I and Shilei Zhao and Hua Chen stage II data indicates the preventing measures and quarantines, such as travel restrict, are very efficient in controlling the outburst of the epidemic. Since more strict quarantine and traffic control measures were executed recently to inhibit the infection of COVID-19 in Han-kou and clinical diagnosis was adopted after February 14, we also analyzed the stage III data (from February 14).

Note that a proportion of the total infected still remains unidentified even with clinical diagnosis. With the inferred parameters, we further plot the longterm predictions of the numbers of total infected (I), unquarantined infected (U ), quarantined infected (Q) and cumulative confirmed infections (C) in Wuhan (Fig. 1A). The end time (increment of confirmed infections equals zero) is predicted to be 147 days from Jan 28, 2020. The total number of infected individuals is 62,577 (Table 1). We can do a similar analysis using stage I data of Wuhan. The stage I data is informative for predicting the epidemic trend assuming no rigorous quarantine and control measures. The first 10 daily data points (from Jan 20) were used to infer the parameters. The rest data points were used to test the performance of the model (Fig. 1C, D).

The lack of data is a major concern for modelers, as it can greatly impact model predictions. One key factor in explaining the variation in these predictions is understanding the relationship between confirmed cases and model predictions. Confirmed cases are individuals with symptoms who have been tested and diagnosed with COVID-19. However, the infected compartment in transmission models includes all infected individuals, whether symptomatic or not, and includes those who have been confirmed via testing as well as those who have not been diagnosed. Confirmed cases represent only a fraction of the total infected population, which can be likened to an iceberg, with the tip above the water symbolizing the case data while the hidden portion below represents the undetected cases, often referred to as the hidden epidemic. \nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

To calibrate a model and estimate key parameters like transmission rate b,  the number of infectious people I(t) must be adjusted based on the case-infection ratio r when fitting the model to confirmed cases data. Different ratios of r can lead to a wide range of transmission rate estimates for COVID-19, resulting in a wide range of model predictions. In modeling, the relationship between r and b, as well as other parameters, can lead to nonidentifiability, where multiple parameter combinations can fit the data well but produce different epidemic predictions. This challenge must be addressed in the model calibration process to ensure the reliability of predictions. Nonlinear least squares methods may not effectively handle nonidentifiability due to their basic optimization algorithms that may not capture the complexity of the data.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ", "original_post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

The value of \u03b2 varies based on the contact type when incorporating realistic network structures (such as households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts). Default transmission probabilities are approximately 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community, with relative weightings of 10:2:2:1. These values were selected to be consistent with time-use surveys and previous studies. In an unmitigated transmission scenario, the majority of transmission events occur in households, workplaces, schools, and the community. The value of \u03b2 can be adjusted by interventions like physical distancing, and individuals can vary in terms of disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and infectivity based on individual viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The daily viral load is used to adjust the transmission probability (\u03b2) per contact for an individual each day. Figure 2 displays viral loads for a sample of individuals with default parameter values. The distribution of transmissions between asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies depending on the situation; estimated proportions for Seattle are provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmission rates are lower when the infected person does not exhibit symptoms [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not lower, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted as necessary based on the modeling context, acknowledging that some studies have suggested much lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage.

The daily viral load is used to adjust the per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an agent on a given day. Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals given default parameter values are shown in Fig 2. The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
