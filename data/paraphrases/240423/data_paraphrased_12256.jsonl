The researchers initiated the spread of the virus in a social network by infecting a node with a degree closest to the average network degree, with subsequent propagation occurring over daily iterations for up to 300 days. The study considered an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1, symbolizing natural social distancing practices and precautions. The researchers noted that this initial value of \u03b2 produced outcomes more closely aligned with the Argentinian pandemic data. After 27 days, a moderate quarantine was implemented to simulate the measures adopted by many Argentinian states, such as Buenos Aires. During this quarantine, certain layers of the social network were removed or had reduced contact rates, with an effective \u03b2 value of 0.09. Essential services and activities with elevated precautionary measures continued, despite the quarantine. The study assessed how different \u03b2 values affected the epidemic curve, with higher values leading to faster disease spread and increased cases and deaths, countered by natural immunization among recovered individuals, which hastened the end of the epidemic.\n\nComparison to real data We compare the model's output in the first 83 days with real data available from the Argentinian epidemic (up to May 19) [5,40\u201342], results are shown on Fig. 4(b).

As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than reported in this paper.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2.
