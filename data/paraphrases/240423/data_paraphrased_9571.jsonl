The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil.

Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5.

To model the gradual noncompliance of universal masking, we make a modification to Equation (9). m(t) = \u03b2s \u2212 \u03b2c 1 + e\u2212k1(\u2212t+t0) + \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2nc 1 + e\u2212k2(\u2212t+t1) + \u03b2nc (10) As individuals began to engage in noncompliance out of complacency and pandemic fatigue, the infection rate, \u03b2nc, would thus increase slightly. Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy.

The contour plot of R_c = 1 gives the threshold values of contact rate and quarantine rate for a city to avoid an outbreak. This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to personal protective and public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts, separation and restriction during the quarantine. Such a high level of quarantine rate and reduction of contact is possible only when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction. A strict travel restriction to the city of Wuhan is expensive and resource-consuming, imposing a substantial challenge to the decision- and policy-makers and the city's resilience. Moreover, such a measure could only delay the transmission of the infectious disorder. ", "original_contents": "time: 22 january 2020; location: wuhan"}

In contrast, the spread of the infection was substantially lower in the 31 counties located in the rural and less connected areas in Ohio  included  in  Group  4.  Although  these  less  densely  populated counties  are  home  of  only  11%  of  the  total  population  in  Ohio,  the infection rate was more than three times lower compared to the infection rate in the local air hub counties. We also identified marked differences in the geographical distribution of the critical healthcare capacity of the state. More than 50% of the total number of ICU beds available are in the five counties included in Group 1 with a rate of 22 ICU beds per 100,000 people. In contrast, only 7% of the total number of ICU beds available in the state are distributed in the 31 counties located in the rural and less connected areas of the state, with a ", "original_post_context": ". Despite these local differences in the critical healthcare capacity of the state, our modeling results suggest that the differential local dynamics of the disease, with substantially  less  transmission  in  these  rural  and  less  connected counties, prevented the saturation of the critical care response in these areas.  We  found  that  if  the  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  implemented in the state in mid-March 2020 were maintained after early May, only 27% of the maximum critical care capacity of the state would be reached, and along with the 10 counties that do not have hospitals with ICU  beds.  Three  more  counties,  Clermont,  Delaware,  and  Lawrence would  reach  more  than  50%  of  their  maximum  critical  care  capacity under  this  scenario.  In  contrast,  our  predictions  indicated  that  if  the intervention is eased by 50%, an estimated 61% of the maximum critical healthcare capacity of the state would be reached eight weeks after the relaxation  of  the  intervention.  However,  areas  with  more  intense transmission of the disease (Group 1) would experience a faster saturation  of  the  critical  care  capacity.  Although  these  counties  had  the highest critical healthcare capacity, the faster and more intense spread of the epidemic experienced in these areas would substantially impact the critical care response in these counties. As a result, the healthcare capacity in these counties would be almost completely saturated (94% of the  maximum  capacity)  eight  weeks  after  the  social  distancing  intervention is eased.

Main text Methods In  the  study,  a  mathematical  model  of  the  spread  and transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  was  formulated.  We  consider  two  interacting  populations,  the  human  population  as  hosts  and  the  pathogens.  The  model  subdivides the  total  human  population  size  at  time  t  denoted  as N(t)  into  susceptible  S(t),  exposed  E(t),  asymptomatic infectious  IA(t) ,  symptomatic  infectious  IS(t)  and  the recovered  as  R(t).  The  pathogen  in  the  environment  is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in  two  ways,  namely:  human  to  human  and  environment to human. The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomatic  IA(t)  and  symptomatic  IS(t)  infected individuals  spread  the  COVID-19  virus  to  susceptible persons  S(t)  with  whom  they  are  in  close  contact.  In addition,  when  infected  individuals  sneeze  or  cough, without  taking  the  necessary  precautions,  the  virus spreads to the environment they are in. Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented. In  the  process  of  disease  spread,  the  susceptible  individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5].

The unique characteristics of COVID-19, such as high infectivity during the incubation period and the efficacy of quarantine and control measures, distinguish it from other infectious diseases. To better understand the dynamics of COVID-19, the authors developed a Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model that explicitly considers the effects of intervention measures.

With more stringent quarantine protocols and traffic controls implemented post-February 12, along with the introduction of clinical diagnosis, an analysis of stage III data (from February 13) was conducted. The estimated quarantine rate was found to be 0.6185, considerably higher than the estimate based on stage II data (0.3917).

The model includes parameters such as the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation (T) and the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation (w).

Luckily in SUQC an accurate value of \u03b1 is not necessary; the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1 as a compound parameter is sensitive in parameter optimization, and thus the bias of \u03b1 can be balanced by g1. Other free parameters and initial values, including g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de and Q\u00f00\u00de, are estimated by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model. Denote ^C=f \u00f0g1,\u03b2,U0,Q0\u00de as the expected daily time series of confirmed infections provided by the model (Eq. 2), which was solved by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with given values of g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de and Q\u00f00\u00de.

We try different initial values in parameter optimization, and notice that the inferred parameter values are not sensitive to the provided initial values. Note that the loss function (Eq. 3) may give too much weight to later observations since the cumulative case numbers are higher than earlier days.

The relationship between data and model predictions is a critical issue, with confirmed cases representing only a portion of the total infected population. A useful analogy is comparing the visible tip of an iceberg (confirmed cases) to the larger, hidden portion below the surface (total infected population), often referred to as the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

During model calibration, in order to determine important model parameters like the transmission rate (b), the model output must be adjusted by the case-infection ratio (r) to accurately predict confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, different values for the transmission rate b can be calculated, affecting the basic reproduction number (R0), epidemic scale, and peak time. Due to the wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary widely, resulting in a range of model predictions. This variability is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling field, where different combinations of parameters can produce similar data fits but divergent predictions about the epidemic. Addressing nonidentifiability during model calibration is crucial for ensuring the reliability of predictions. Conventional methods like nonlinear least squares may struggle to address this issue effectively, as they rely on basic optimization algorithms that may not account for the multitude of possible global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

The value of \u03b2 varies depending on the type of contact when incorporating a realistic network structure including households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts. The default transmission probabilities are around 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for community contacts. These values were chosen based on research findings and time-use surveys to provide a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a population without different network layers. Without interventions, transmission events typically occur 30% in households, 25% in workplaces, 15% in schools, and 30% in the community. The \u03b2 value can be adjusted by interventions such as physical distancing. We also consider individual differences in disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and infectiousness by modeling individual viral load.\n\nSeveral studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

Figure 2 displays viral loads for a sample of individuals with default parameter values. The percentage of transmissions from asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the situation; estimates for Seattle are provided in [25]. Research has conflicting findings on whether transmissibility is reduced when the infected person does not display symptoms [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not lower, but we have a parameter that can be adjusted based on the specific modeling scenario or context. It is worth noting that some studies have suggested much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The daily viral load is used to adjust the per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an agent on a given day. Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals given default parameter values are shown in Fig 2. The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
