The researchers initiated a social network with its original infection probabilities, starting the epidemic at a node with a degree closest to the network average. They simulated an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, leading to a lower initial infection probability (\u03b2 < 1) due to natural social distancing practices. After 27 days, a moderate quarantine was implemented, reducing contacts and removing certain layers of the network. This quarantine was akin to measures taken in Mexico on March 24, such as in Mexico City.

We assumed a constant isolation level similar to what was seen in the first days after government decrees in Mexico, but data indicates that these levels are constantly changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the remaining simulation may be higher than those reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). Regarding the daily death toll, the average number from the proposed models is higher than the official numbers, which is expected due to potentially higher underdetection rates and fewer tests being conducted. To further explore this, we analyzed the number of deaths in Mexico from January 1 to April 30, comparing figures between 2019 and 2020, as shown in Fig. 5. A clear increasing trend is evident after February 26, the date of Mexico's first confirmed COVID-19 case, suggesting that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported. Moving forward, after the initial epidemic phase, we are considering four potential actions to be taken after 90 days (by May 26): a) maintaining current isolation levels with no further actions; b) lifting isolation measures and returning to normal activities (initial network layers and weights); c) resuming only work activities with the initial layer probabilities restored; or d) increasing isolation by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312", "original_pre_context": "eiva et al.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5.

To model the gradual noncompliance of universal masking, we make a modification to Equation (9). m(t) = \u03b2s \u2212 \u03b2c 1 + e\u2212k1(\u2212t+t0) + \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2nc 1 + e\u2212k2(\u2212t+t1) + \u03b2nc (10) As individuals began to engage in noncompliance out of complacency and pandemic fatigue, the infection rate, \u03b2nc, would thus increase slightly. Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy.

Introduction Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family of Coronaviridae [1]. They cause generally mild respiratory infections, even though they are occasionally lethal. Since their discovery and first characterization in 1965 [2], three major, large-scale outbreaks have occurred, caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely, the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS) outbreak in 2003 in mainland China [3], the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [4,5] and the MERS outbreak in 2015 in South J.

It is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 January 2020, as shown in Table 4. Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to our model, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value.

The year-end infection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750\u00a0K infections and 10.2\u00a0K deaths)16. Predicted population dynamics are shown in Fig.\u00a03. The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig.\u00a03a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment. By the end of June 2021, only 37% of the Ontario population are susceptible, with the majority having received at least one dose of vaccine (Fig.\u00a03b,c). The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig.\u00a03d). These are the wild-type and Alpha-driven waves identified in Fig.\u00a02a and described above. The Alpha-driven infection peak accounts for 0.7% of the total population, but subsides as the vaccination effort accelerates. The infections are split approximately half-half between asymptomatic and symptomatic ones, with the majority unvaccinated (Fig.\u00a03d\u2013g). As the infection spreads, the recovered population also increases, to 7% of the population at the end of 2021 (Fig.\u00a03h). These dynamics are summarized as fractions of the population that are susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered, as shown in Fig.\u00a03i. Sensitivity analysis.

The vaccine-related results suggest that among these three factors, an effective vaccine deployment (captured in \u03c91) is the key in combating a pandemic, and success may be achieved even by means of a less-than-ideal vaccine with higher escape rate (Fig.\u00a04). Since the predicted numbers of infections and deaths are substantially more sensitive to variations in \u03c91 than \u03c92, if vaccine supply is limited, prioritizing the first dose by lengthening the dosing interval would be advisable, as was done in Canada. In a second sensitivity analysis, we considered the full model that represents all three variants, using the baseline parameter values (Table\u00a0S1). Key model parameters were increased to determine the effects on the number of infections and deaths associated with each variant. In addition to parameters considered in the above analysis, we also considered two parameters that mediate VOC interactions: \u03b2X R, rate of infection of individuals with partial immunity from having recovered from a different variant, and \u03b7R, rate of loss of immunity due to infection. Some of these parameters have distinct values for each of the variants. Simulations were conducted by varying each of the parameter values for individual variants separately. Specifically, \u03b2X (X = W, A, or D), \u03c3X, \u03b1X, \u03b3X, and \u03c91 were increased by 5%, \u03bb by 10%, and \u03bcI, \u03b2X R was increased 4 folds to assess the V, and \u03c92 by 50%. \u03b2X Scientific Reports |         (2022) 12:2114  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 4 Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/", "original_contents": "time:  2020"}

Zhao et al. used a quantitative approach to estimate the under-reporting rate of cases, with a computed number of 469 (95% CI 403e540) and a basic reproduction number of 2.56 (95% CI 2.49e2.63). Previous versions of the study had reported a range of 3.30 to 5.47 for the reproduction number. Additionally, the basic reproduction number was found to be linked to an increase in the reporting rate. More in detail, with report rates increasing over the time, the mean value was statistically likely to be higher than 3 but less than 5. Read and coauthors (Read et al., 2020) used a deterministic SEIR model, assuming coronavirus cases being Poisson distributed and with parameter inference being achieved by maximum likelihood estimation utilizing the Nelder-Mead optimization approach. According to the dynamics transmission model, an ascertainment rate of 5.0% (95% CI 3.6e7.4) was computed and, based on this, authors estimated that as of January 22nd, 2020 in Shanghai there were 14,464 (95% CI 6510e25095) infected individuals, and 21,022 (95% CI 11,090e33,490) infections.

Within the existing literature, two studies estimated under-estimation of coronavirus cases: the investigations by Zhao and collaborators (Zhao et al., 2020) and by Read et al.

Specifically, Zhao and coworkers (Zhao et al., 2020) have assessed from a quantitative standpoint the under-reporting rate of coronavirus cases, modeling the epidemic growth curve using the exponential growing Poisson process. Authors computed the number of under-reported coronavirus cases to be 469 (95% CI 403e540). Based on this estimate, the basic reproduction number was found to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49e2.63). In a previous version of the investigation, released in the bioRxiv pre-print server, the reproduction number was computed to oscillate between 3.30 (95% CI 2.73e3.96) and 5.47 (95% CI 4.16e7.10).

This indicates that the epidemic outbreak in Hangzhou was effectively managed by Chinese authorities. As for the local stability in relation to the basic reproduction number, the two equations and the fifth equation of system (1) are independent from the other equations in the system. Through direct integration, we derive the following analytical results: A(t) = \u03ba(1 \u2212 \u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 ) \u222b0t E(s) ds, R(t) = \u03b3i \u222b0t I(s) + P(s)H(s) ds, and F(t) = \u03b4i \u222b0t I(s) + \u03b4p \u222b0t H(s) ds.

Main text Methods In  the  study,  a  mathematical  model  of  the  spread  and transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  was  formulated.  We  consider  two  interacting  populations,  the  human  population  as  hosts  and  the  pathogens.  The  model  subdivides the  total  human  population  size  at  time  t  denoted  as N(t)  into  susceptible  S(t),  exposed  E(t),  asymptomatic infectious  IA(t) ,  symptomatic  infectious  IS(t)  and  the recovered  as  R(t).  The  pathogen  in  the  environment  is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in  two  ways,  namely:  human  to  human  and  environment to human. The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomatic  IA(t)  and  symptomatic  IS(t)  infected individuals  spread  the  COVID-19  virus  to  susceptible persons  S(t)  with  whom  they  are  in  close  contact.  In addition,  when  infected  individuals  sneeze  or  cough, without  taking  the  necessary  precautions,  the  virus spreads to the environment they are in. Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented. In  the  process  of  disease  spread,  the  susceptible  individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5]. The exposed individual  moves  to  either  asymptomatic  IA(t)  or  symptomatic  IS(t)  infectious  population.

Using the inferred parameters, we conducted long-term predictions for total infected (I), unquarantined infected (U), quarantined infected (Q), and cumulative confirmed infections (C) in Hubei (Fig. 1A). The predicted end time, where the rate of confirmed infections stops increasing, is estimated to be 147 days from Jan 28, 2020, with a total of 62,577 infected individuals (Table 1). A similar analysis was conducted using stage I data from Hubei to predict the epidemic trend under the assumption of no strict quarantine or control measures.

This concept is incorporated into a set of ODE equations that model the dynamics of infectious diseases and the impact of artificial interventions (Eq.1). In this model, infected individuals U can either directly transition to confirmed infections C or indirectly go through quarantine Q. The direct transition can be considered a special case of the indirect transition with zero delay time, thus simplifying the model to Eq. 2. Key parameters T (mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation) and w (mean time delay from isolation to confirmation) can be derived from the SUQC model to monitor and predict disease trends. Additionally, the reproductive number R is defined as \u03b1=g1 in the model. When inferring parameters from the model, cumulative confirmed infections C(t) is the variable typically used for fitting and inference due to its daily availability in observed data. The initial values of susceptible individuals (S(0)) and confirmed infections (C(0)) are typically set to the population size and the number of initially reported infections, respectively.\n\nNote that the initial time of the ODE system does not have to be at the beginning of the epidemic, and can start from any time point during the break of COVID-19.

Confirmed infection numbers during this time period may be less influenced by bias and better reflect the natural characteristics of COVID-19. At early stages before January 19, confirmed numbers are small and fluctuating, while they are impacted by strict quarantine measures in later stages. The parameter \u03b1 is challenging to estimate accurately, with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 based on different methods or data sets. Fortunately, in the SUQC model, an exact value of \u03b1 is not essential; the overall infection ability, measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1, can adjust for the bias of \u03b1 through g1. Other parameters and initial values, including g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de, and Q\u00f00\u00de, are determined by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model.

Confirmed infected numbers during this time interval may be less biased and represent natural character of COVID-19, while confirmed numbers are small and fluctuating at early stages before Jan 20 and are affected by strict quarantine measures in later stages.

Luckily in SUQC an accurate value of \u03b1 is not necessary; the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1 as a compound parameter is sensitive in parameter optimization, and thus the bias of \u03b1 can be balanced by g1. Other free parameters and initial values, including g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de and Q\u00f00\u00de, are estimated by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model.

Our focus is on the lack of data, which poses a greater concern for modellers. One key issue that can explain the variation in model predictions is understanding the relationship between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical attention, were tested, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed. In transmission models, the infected compartment encompasses all individuals with the virus, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, those who have been tested and those who have not. Therefore, confirmed cases are merely a subset of the total infected population as projected by the model. To illustrate this concept, we use the metaphor of an iceberg; the entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, with the tip above the sea surface representing the case data, while the submerged part represents the unknown infected individuals not captured by testing or public health surveillance, often termed the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

During model calibration, in order to determine important parameters like the transmission rate b, the model output must be adjusted to account for the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), by using the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed case data. By testing different values of r, the transmission rate b can be calculated by fitting the model to the data, which also determines the basic reproduction number R0, the size of the epidemic, and the peak time. Due to the wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary greatly, resulting in a wide range of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, means that different combinations of parameters can produce similar fits to the data but lead to vastly different epidemic predictions. The way nonidentifiability is handled during model calibration greatly impacts the reliability of the predictions. Standard optimization algorithms, like nonlinear least squares, may not be effective in addressing nonidentifiability, as they seek to find a global minimum without considering the possibility of multiple global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ", "original_post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

Unlike SARS, where infectiousness typically begins two days after symptoms appear, evidence suggests that infected individuals with COVID-19 may be able to spread the virus before showing symptoms.

This is biologically plausible due to the incubation period of COVID-19 lasting up to 14 days, during which time infected individuals may not be contagious. It is important to distinguish between the latent period, which is the time from infection to contagiousness, and the incubation period, which is the time from infection to symptom onset. In the case of SARS, infected individuals become contagious around two days after symptoms appear. Evidence suggests that those with COVID-19 can spread the virus before showing symptoms, but the exact length of the latent period is unknown. The SEIR model is more realistic biologically compared to the SIR model, but it requires additional parameters such as the latent period and initial latent population. Data calibration for both models is based on confirmed cases and does not include deaths in the S, E, and I compartments.

Model selection analysis for an SEIR and an SIR model We used both SEIR and SIR frameworks to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, and we applied model selection analysis to decide which framework is more parsimonious. 3.1.

In the SEIR model, a latent compartment E is added to denote the individuals who are infected but not infectious. The latency of COVID-19 infection is biologically realistic due to an incubation period as long as 14 days; newly infected individuals may not be infectious while the virus is incubating in the body. Here we note the difference between the latent period, which is the period from the time an individual is infected to the time the individual is infectious, and the incubation period, which is the period between the time an individual is infected to the time clinical symptoms appear, which include fever and coughing for COVID-19. For SARS, infected individuals become infectious on average two days after the onset of symptoms WHO (2003); so, the SARS latent period is on average longer than the incubation period. For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020), but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population. The transfer diagrams for both models are shown in Fig. 1. The biological meaning of all model parameters are given in Table 1 and Table 2. A key assumption in both models is that deaths occurring in the S, E, and I compartments are negligible during the period of model predictions. (4 months). Since we use the newly confirmed case data for model calibration, which is matched to the rI term in both models, the death term in the R compartment has no effect on our model fitting.

When incorporating a realistic network structure (including households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts), the value of \u03b2 varies depending on the type of contact. Default transmission probabilities are around 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community, with relative weightings of 10:2:2:1.

As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage.

There is conflicting evidence on whether transmission is lower when the infectious individual shows no symptoms [55].

Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage.
