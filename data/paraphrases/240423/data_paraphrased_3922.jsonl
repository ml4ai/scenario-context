The study utilized a social network model, starting with original infection probabilities across all layers. The infection initially begins at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spreads over 300 days. The researchers considered an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in a lower initial infection probability (\u03b2 < 1) due to natural social distancing measures. After 27 days, a moderate quarantine similar to the measures implemented in Peru on March 24 was applied, reducing contacts on certain layers to 30% of their initial values (\u03b2 = 0.09).

As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than reported in this paper. The average daily death toll in the proposed models is higher than official numbers, potentially due to underdetection rates and limited testing.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2.

To model the gradual noncompliance of universal masking, we make a modification to Equation (9). m(t) = \u03b2s \u2212 \u03b2c 1 + e\u2212k1(\u2212t+t0) + \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2nc 1 + e\u2212k2(\u2212t+t1) + \u03b2nc (10) As individuals began to engage in noncompliance out of complacency and pandemic fatigue, the infection rate, \u03b2nc, would thus increase slightly. Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy.

At that time, 11\u00a0K would have died from COVID, with 36, 47, and 17% from wild type, Alpha, and Delta, respectively (Fig.\u00a02d). The year-end infection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750\u00a0K infections and 10.2\u00a0K deaths)16. Predicted population dynamics are shown in Fig.\u00a03. The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig.\u00a03a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment. By the end of June 2021, only 37% of the Ontario population are susceptible, with the majority having received at least one dose of vaccine (Fig.\u00a03b,c). The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig.\u00a03d). These are the wild-type and Alpha-driven waves identified in Fig.\u00a02a and described above. The Alpha-driven infection peak accounts for 0.7% of the total population, but subsides as the vaccination effort accelerates. The infections are split approximately half-half between asymptomatic and symptomatic ones, with the majority unvaccinated (Fig.\u00a03d\u2013g). As the infection spreads, the recovered population also increases, to 7% of the population at the end of 2021 (Fig.\u00a03h). These dynamics are summarized as fractions of the population that are susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered, as shown in Fig.\u00a03i. Sensitivity analysis.

Key model parameters were increased to determine the effects on the number of infections and deaths associated with each variant. In addition to parameters considered in the above analysis, we also considered two parameters that mediate VOC interactions: \u03b2X R, rate of infection of individuals with partial immunity from having recovered from a different variant, and \u03b7R, rate of loss of immunity due to infection. Some of these parameters have distinct values for each of the variants. Simulations were conducted by varying each of the parameter values for individual variants separately. Specifically, \u03b2X (X = W, A, or D), \u03c3X, \u03b1X, \u03b3X, and \u03c91 were increased by 5%, \u03bb by 10%, and \u03bcI, \u03b2X R was increased 4 folds to assess the V, and \u03c92 by 50%. \u03b2X Scientific Reports |         (2022) 12:2114  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 4 Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/", "original_contents": "time:  2020"}

Analytical results were obtained through direct integration, revealing specific relationships between the variables. The stability of the model was further analyzed by focusing on the remaining coupled state variables.

Main text Methods In  the  study,  a  mathematical  model  of  the  spread  and transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  was  formulated.  We  consider  two  interacting  populations,  the  human  population  as  hosts  and  the  pathogens.  The  model  subdivides the  total  human  population  size  at  time  t  denoted  as N(t)  into  susceptible  S(t),  exposed  E(t),  asymptomatic infectious  IA(t) ,  symptomatic  infectious  IS(t)  and  the recovered  as  R(t).  The  pathogen  in  the  environment  is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in  two  ways,  namely:  human  to  human  and  environment to human. The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomatic  IA(t)  and  symptomatic  IS(t)  infected individuals  spread  the  COVID-19  virus  to  susceptible persons  S(t)  with  whom  they  are  in  close  contact.  In addition,  when  infected  individuals  sneeze  or  cough, without  taking  the  necessary  precautions,  the  virus spreads to the environment they are in. Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented. In  the  process  of  disease  spread,  the  susceptible  individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5]. The exposed individual  moves  to  either  asymptomatic  IA(t)  or  symptomatic  IS(t)  infectious  population.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Conclusions: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei.

This is modeled through a set of ODE equations to simulate the dynamics of an infectious disease and control through artificial factors. In the model, infected individuals can go directly from being un-quarantined to confirmed cases, or indirectly through quarantine. Simplifying the model with zero delay time during this process results in a more streamlined equation (Eq. 2). Parameters like T (mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation), w (mean time delay from isolation to confirmation), and the reproductive number R (infection rate) can be defined from this model. When inferring parameters, the cumulative confirmed infections (C(t)) are typically the only variables used, with the initial values of susceptible individuals (S(0)) and confirmed infections (C(0)) derived from official reports. Note that the initial time of the ODE system does not have to be at the beginning of the epidemic, and can start from any time point during the break of COVID-19.

During this time period, the number of confirmed infections may be more accurate and reflect the natural characteristics of COVID-19, as confirmed numbers are initially low and fluctuating before January 25 and are influenced by strict quarantine measures in later stages. Estimating the parameter \u03b1 accurately is challenging, with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 when using different methods or data sets. Fortunately, in the SUQC model, an exact value of \u03b1 is not essential; the overall infection ability, represented by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1, is sensitive in parameter optimization, allowing for the balancing of any bias in \u03b1 with g1. Various free parameters and initial values, such as g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de, and Q\u00f00\u00de, are determined by fitting the daily confirmed infection data to the model.

Confirmed infected numbers during this time interval may be less biased and represent natural character of COVID-19, while confirmed numbers are small and fluctuating at early stages before Jan 20 and are affected by strict quarantine measures in later stages.

Luckily in SUQC an accurate value of \u03b1 is not necessary; the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1 as a compound parameter is sensitive in parameter optimization, and thus the bias of \u03b1 can be balanced by g1. Other free parameters and initial values, including g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de and Q\u00f00\u00de, are estimated by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model.

However, the lack of data is a more critical issue for modellers. One key factor contributing to variability in model predictions is the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical attention, were tested, and tested positive for COVID-19 through DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all infected individuals, regardless of symptoms, hospital contacts, confirmed testing, or misdiagnoses. Confirmed cases represent only a portion of the total infected population predicted by the model, akin to the tip of an iceberg protruding above the water's surface, while the bulk of the iceberg beneath the water symbolizes the hidden epidemic of infected individuals not captured by public health surveillance and testing. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021). Why is this problematic for modellers? When calibrating models, it is necessary to adjust the estimated transmission rate b by taking into account the total number of infectious individuals I(t) and the case-infection ratio r in order to accurately predict confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, different estimates for the transmission rate b can be obtained, which ultimately determines the basic reproduction number R0, the scale of the epidemic, and the peak time. Due to the wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary greatly, leading to a wide range of model predictions. This variability is known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, where different combinations of parameters can produce similar fits to the data but result in very different epidemic predictions. The way in which nonidentifiability is addressed during model calibration directly impacts the reliability of model predictions. Traditional nonlinear least squares methods are limited in their ability to address nonidentifiability due to their basic optimization algorithms, which may struggle to find the best solution among many possible global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm.

We refer the reader to recent lecture notes (Portet, 2020) for an introduction to model selection. 3. Model selection analysis for an SEIR and an SIR model We used both SEIR and SIR frameworks to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, and we applied model selection analysis to decide which framework is more parsimonious. 3.1. The models In our SIR and SEIR models, the compartment S denotes the susceptible population in Wuhan, compartment I denotes the infectious population, and ", "original_post_context": ". In the SEIR model, a latent compartment E is added to denote the individuals who are infected but not infectious. The latency of COVID-19 infection is biologically realistic due to an incubation period as long as 14 days; newly infected individuals may not be infectious while the virus is incubating in the body. Here we note the difference between the latent period, which is the period from the time an individual is infected to the time the individual is infectious, and the incubation period, which is the period between the time an individual is infected to the time clinical symptoms appear, which include fever and coughing for COVID-19. For SARS, infected individuals become infectious on average two days after the onset of symptoms WHO (2003); so, the SARS latent period is on average longer than the incubation period. For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020), but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population. The transfer diagrams for both models are shown in Fig. 1. The biological meaning of all model parameters are given in Table 1 and Table 2. A key assumption in both models is that deaths occurring in the S, E, and I compartments are negligible during the period of model predictions. (4 months). Since we use the newly confirmed case data for model calibration, which is matched to the rI term in both models, the death term in the R compartment has no effect on our model fitting.

The value of \u03b2 varies based on different contact types when incorporating realistic network structures (e.g. households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts). Default transmission probabilities are around 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values are based on relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, selected for consistency with time-use surveys and known contact type studies, aiming to maintain a weighted average close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016.

We also allow for variations in individual infectiousness over time and between people by using individual viral load in the model.Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the context, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced if the infectious individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted based on the specific modeling application or context, recognizing that some studies have suggested much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58].

We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
