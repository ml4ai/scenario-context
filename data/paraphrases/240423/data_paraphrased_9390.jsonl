The infection initially started at a node with a degree closest to the network average and spread over 300 days in daily iterations.\n\nThe researchers considered an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the beginning, resulting in an initial infection probability (\u03b2) of less than 1. This represented a form of social distancing through reduced direct contact and preventive measures like sneezing and coughing etiquette. The study found that this initial \u03b2 value correlated closely with the trajectory of the pandemic in Peru.\n\nAfter 27 days, a moderate quarantine was implemented to mirror the measures taken by Peruvian states in late March. During this period, certain layers of activities were removed or reduced, with contacts in transports and workplaces decreased to 30% of their original value (\u03b2 = 0.09). Essential services and activities that could not be halted continued while observing higher precautionary measures.\n\nThe impact of the \u03b2 parameter on the epidemic curve was then analyzed. The results, shown in Fig. 4(a), demonstrated that higher infection rates led to faster disease spread and increased cases and deaths. However, the epidemic also ended sooner due to natural immunization of recovered individuals.\n\nComparison to real data We compare the model's output in the first 83 days with real data available from the Peruvian epidemic (up to May 19) [5,40\u201342], results are shown on Fig. 4(b).

As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in the simulation may be higher than reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). In terms of daily death toll, the average number from our models is higher than the official numbers, which is likely due to underdetection rates and limited testing.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5.

Variability in the estimation of the basic reproduction number is also a well-known methodological issue, and standardized methods both for calculating and reporting it are still lacking [30]. During the initial phases of an epidemics outbreak, only small datasets/time-points can be used. Some crucial information may be missing, and the quality, accuracy and reliability of data improves over time. In these situations, estimations are highly dependent on the specific datasets utilized and revising/updating such datasets could influence the results. We note that several key clinical parameters could be inferred from relevant clinical data based on sero-epidemiological surveys, and the possibility of spreading the infection from asymptomatic cases was only reported recently [31]. Our finding of a high reproduction number implies the potential of a very serious epidemic unless rather swift public health interventions are implemented [32,33], during the season when the social contacts is the highest. Note that the serial interval is an essential factor affecting the accuracy of the likelihood function estimation. According to the current report, the incubation period of Wuhan patients with coronavirus pneumonia is about 2 to 15 days. We then assume that the serial interval follows the gamma distribution with varying mean and variance, which allows us to examine the influence on the reproduction number. With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation. It shows that longer serial intervals induce greater reproduction numbers, and hence, more new infections, which further confirms that the epidemic may be more serious than what has been reported until now [15].

In comparison with the total population size of Wuhan, the effort of close contact tracing and quarantine was insufficient and appears to have a limited impact in terms of reducing the number of infected cases and/or slowing down the epidemic. The contour plot of R_c = 1 gives the threshold values of contact rate and quarantine rate for a city to avoid an outbreak. This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to personal protective and public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts, separation and restriction during the quarantine. Such a high level of quarantine rate and reduction of contact is possible only when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction. A strict travel restriction to the city of Wuhan is expensive and resource-consuming, imposing a substantial challenge to the decision- and policy-makers and the city's resilience. Moreover, such a measure could only delay the transmission of the infectious disorder. ", "original_contents": "time: 22 january 2020; location: wuhan"}

The year-end infection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750\u00a0K infections and 10.2\u00a0K deaths)16. Predicted population dynamics are shown in Fig.\u00a03. The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig.\u00a03a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment.

Small variations in these four parameters (5%) result in changes in the number of infections and deaths that are an order of magnitude larger; see Fig.\u00a04. COVID-19 mortality rate \u03bcW I affects the number of infected individuals who are alive and can participate in the spread of the disease. Because COVID-19 mortality rate can vary substantially depending on health care infrastructure, we varied \u03bcW I by 50%. As expected, changes in \u03bcW I are immediately reflected in the number of deaths. However, compared to other clinical features of SARS- CoV-2, the mortality rate has a relatively small effect on the infected population, since < 5% of them die (Fig.\u00a04). Provincial policy and pharmaceutical interventions that were considered include NPI that reduce the effective disease infectivity (via scaling by \u03bb), vaccination rate (\u03c91), delay between the first and second vaccine doses (\u03c92,PZ and \u03c92,AZ, varied simultaneously), and ", "original_post_context": " \u03bb and \u03c91 are varied by 5%. Since NPI are modelled by scaling \u03b2W directly, they have large effects on model predictions (Fig.\u00a04). Vaccination rate has lesser but still significant effects on the spread of the disease. The effects of dosing interval (\u03c92) and vaccine escape rate (\u03b2W V) are much smaller. Because dosing interval can vary greatly within the population, and because vaccine escape rate is not sufficiently well characterized, these two parameters were varied by 50%. The vaccine-related results suggest that among these three factors, an effective vaccine deployment (captured in \u03c91) is the key in combating a pandemic, and success may be achieved even by means of a less-than-ideal vaccine with higher escape rate (Fig.\u00a04). Since the predicted numbers of infections and deaths are substantially more sensitive to variations in \u03c91 than \u03c92, if vaccine supply is limited, prioritizing the first dose by lengthening the dosing interval would be advisable, as was done in Canada. In a second sensitivity analysis, we considered the full model that represents all three variants, using the baseline parameter values (Table\u00a0S1). Key model parameters were increased to determine the effects on the number of infections and deaths associated with each variant. In addition to parameters considered in the above analysis, we also considered two parameters that mediate VOC interactions: \u03b2X R, rate of infection of individuals with partial immunity from having recovered from a different variant, and \u03b7R, rate of loss of immunity due to infection. Some of these parameters have distinct values for each of the variants. Simulations were conducted by varying each of the parameter values for individual variants separately. Specifically, \u03b2X (X = W, A, or D), \u03c3X, \u03b1X, \u03b3X, and \u03c91 were increased by 5%, \u03bb by 10%, and \u03bcI, \u03b2X R was increased 4 folds to assess the V, and \u03c92 by 50%. \u03b2X Scientific Reports |         (2022) 12:2114  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 4 Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/", "original_contents": "time:  2020"}

Research has shown that the COVID-19 virus can spread through human-to-human and environment-to-human transmission. Both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) individuals can transmit the virus to susceptible persons S(t) through close contact. Additionally, the virus can spread to the environment when infected individuals sneeze or cough without precautions, potentially exposing susceptible individuals S(t). In the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak before hygiene measures are implemented, individuals in close contact with contaminated environments are at increased risk of exposure to the pathogen P(t) that can survive for days. The disease spreads as susceptible individuals transition to the exposed population E(t) due to an incubation period. Those exposed may then become asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) before potentially recovering and moving to the recovered population R(t). The compartmental model illustrating the interaction between the human population and the pathogen is displayed in Fig. 1, with the parameters outlined in Table 1.

The local medical agency in The city of Shanghai began employing clinical diagnosis as a supplementary criterion for diagnosis post Feb 14, resulting in a significant rise in confirmed infections. Despite this, there still remains a portion of total infected individuals who are not identified even with clinical diagnosis. By utilizing inferred parameters, long-term predictions of total infected, unquarantined infected, quarantined infected, and cumulative confirmed infections in The city of Shanghai are plotted in Figure 1A. The model predicts that the end time (when the confirmed infections stop increasing) will be 147 days from January 28, 2020, with a total of 62,577 infected individuals. Similar analyses can be conducted using The city of Shanghai's stage I data, which can help predict epidemic trends without stringent quarantine measures. By using the first 10 daily data points from January 20 to infer parameters and the remaining data to test the model's performance, it is evident that the predicted numbers of confirmed and infected individuals (C(t) and I(t)) sharply rise beyond observed numbers after January 21, as shown in Figure 1C. The number of total infected can be as large as 8,923,823, and the epidemic lasts for a much longer time (328 days, see Table 1). The dramatic difference between predictions from stage I and Shilei Zhao and Hua Chen stage II data indicates the preventing measures and quarantines, such as travel restrict, are very efficient in controlling the outburst of the epidemic. Since more strict quarantine and traffic control measures were executed recently to inhibit the infection of COVID-19 in The city of Shanghai and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 14, we also analyzed the stage III data (from Feb 14).

The differences in predicted numbers of infections between the two stages underscore the importance of quarantine and control measures. Notably, Beijing demonstrated a reproductive number below 1 even with stage I data, indicating a prompt and effective response to COVID-19 at an early stage. The confirmation rate varied significantly among regions, with The city of Shanghai having the lowest rate due to an overwhelming number of infected individuals.

Clinical diagnosis is adopted by Wuhan local medical agency as an additional diagnosis criterion after Feb 12, increasing the confirmation rate and causing a big boost of the number of confirmed infections. Note that a proportion of the total infected still remains unidentified even with clinical diagnosis. With the inferred parameters, we further plot the longterm predictions of the numbers of total infected (I), unquarantined infected (U ), quarantined infected (Q) and cumulative confirmed infections (C) in Wuhan (Fig. 1A). The end time (increment of confirmed infections equals zero) is predicted to be 147 days from Jan 28, 2020. The total number of infected individuals is 62,577 (Table 1). We can do a similar analysis using stage I data of Wuhan. The stage I data is informative for predicting the epidemic trend assuming no rigorous quarantine and control measures.

To model the dynamics of an infectious disease and the control by artificial factors, a set of ODE equations (Eq.1) is established. In the model, infected individuals either go directly to being confirmed (C), or indirectly through quarantine (Q). By simplifying the model and removing the direct way, we arrive at Eq. 2. Parameters such as the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation (T=1/g1) and the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation (w=1/(g2 - (1 - g2))) can be defined based on the SUQC model. The reproductive number of the infection is R=\u03b1/g1.

However, the lack of data poses a more significant challenge for modellers. One key factor in understanding the variations in model predictions lies in comparing the available data (confirmed cases) with the model's projections. Confirmed cases refer to individuals showing symptoms who sought medical attention, underwent testing, and received a positive COVID-19 diagnosis through DNA or imaging tests. In transmission models, the infected compartment encompasses all infected individuals, regardless of symptoms, those in contact with hospitals, individuals with confirmed testing, and those who may be misdiagnosed. Therefore, confirmed cases (data) only represent a portion of the total infected population estimated by the model. An iceberg serves as a fitting analogy for this disparity between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg symbolizes the total infected population, with the visible tip above the water representing the case data, while the submerged portion illustrates the infected individuals who elude public health surveillance and testing\u2014referred to as the hidden epidemic.The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021).Why is this problematic for modelers? During model calibration, in order to estimate key parameters such as the transmission rate b by fitting the model output to confirmed cases data, it is necessary to adjust the total number of infectious individuals I(t) in the model prediction by the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed case data. By varying the ratio r, different values for the transmission rate b can be estimated through data fitting, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R0, the epidemic scale, and peak time. With the wide range of possible case-infection ratios for COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b also varies widely, leading to a range of model predictions. This variability in predictions is known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, where different combinations of parameters can produce similar fits to data but divergent epidemic forecasts. Addressing nonidentifiability in model calibration is crucial for the reliability of predictions. Traditional methods, like nonlinear least squares, may struggle with this issue as they rely on basic optimization algorithms that may not effectively handle the complexity of the problem.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

It is important to differentiate between the latent period, which is the time between infection and becoming infectious, and the incubation period, which is the time between infection and the onset of symptoms like fever and coughing. Unlike SARS, where individuals become infectious around two days after symptoms appear, evidence suggests that those with COVID-19 can spread the virus before showing symptoms.

The latency of COVID-19 infection is biologically realistic due to an incubation period as long as 14 days; newly infected individuals may not be infectious while the virus is incubating in the body. Here we note the difference between the latent period, which is the period from the time an individual is infected to the time the individual is infectious, and the incubation period, which is the period between the time an individual is infected to the time clinical symptoms appear, which include fever and coughing for COVID-19. For SARS, infected individuals become infectious on average two days after the onset of symptoms WHO (2003); so, the SARS latent period is on average longer than the incubation period. For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020), but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population. The transfer diagrams for both models are shown in Fig. 1. The biological meaning of all model parameters are given in Table 1 and Table 2. A key assumption in both models is that deaths occurring in the S, E, and I compartments are negligible during the period of model predictions. (4 months).

When incorporating realistic network structures (such as households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts), the value of \u03b2 is influenced by the type of contact. Default transmission probabilities are around 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values are based on weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen for consistency with time-use surveys and studies on infections with known contact types.

Without interventions, the proportions of transmission events in each contact layer are approximately 30% households, 25% workplaces, 15% schools, and 30% community. Interventions, such as physical distancing, can modify the value of \u03b2. In addition to individual differences in disease severity and time spent in each disease state, individual infectiousness can vary between people and over time, which is modeled using individual viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The daily viral load is utilized to adjust the per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an individual on any given day. Fig 2 displays viral loads for a sample of individuals with default parameter values. The distribution of transmissions from asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary by location, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced when the infectious individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted depending on the modeling context, as some studies suggest lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load for each agent is drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean 1.0 and shape ", "original_post_context": ", which was the value most consistent with both international estimates [59,60] and fits to data in Washington state and Oregon. The daily viral load is used to adjust the per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an agent on a given day. Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals given default parameter values are shown in Fig 2. The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
