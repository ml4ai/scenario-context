Physica A 564 (2021) 125498 examines the impact of various interventions on the progression of an epidemic, including changes in case numbers, fatalities, and hospital occupancy. The study begins by modeling a social network with its original infection probabilities, with the infection starting at a node with a degree close to the network average. A scenario where individuals are aware of the virus from the start is considered, resulting in a lower initial infection probability (\u03b2 < 1) due to natural social distancing measures. After 27 days, a moderate quarantine is imposed, reducing contact rates and isolating certain activities. The study found that this approach yielded results more closely aligned with the South American pandemic. The effects of varying the \u03b2 parameter on the epidemic curve are analyzed, showing that higher infection rates lead to quicker disease spread but also to faster termination through natural immunity.\n\nComparison to real data We compare the model's output in the first 83 days with real data available from the South American epidemic (up to May 20) [5,40\u201342], results are shown on Fig. 4(b).

Our analysis assumes a fixed isolation level similar to what was initially observed after government decrees in South America, but data indicates that these levels are constantly changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in our simulation may be higher than reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the following section). In terms of daily death toll, the average number from our models is higher than official numbers, which could be attributed to higher underdetection rates due to limited testing. To further explore this, we compared the number of deaths in South America from January 1 to April 30 between 2019 and 2020, showing an increasing trend post-February 26, the date of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in South America. This suggests that the actual death toll could be significantly higher than reported figures. Moving forward, after the initial epidemic phase, we discuss four potential actions that could be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) maintain current isolation levels; b) end isolation and resume normal activities; c) only return to work activities; or d) increase isolation by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312", "original_pre_context": "eiva et al. Physica A 564 (2021) 125498 the effects of different actions on the overall epidemic picture, such as the increase and reduction of cases, deaths, and occupied beds in hospitals. The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2.

Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy.

Considering the most basic case of Scenario 1; where there is complete compliance throughout the duration of mask enforcement, and the absence of time-limited immunity, Figure 3 shows the cases where mask wearing were to be enforced (a) on the day the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Singapore; (b) after a 50 days delay; (c) after a 100 days delay; and (d) not enforced at all. From Figure 3, it can be deduced that earlier enforcement of mask wearing both reduces the Maximum Infected Value as well as increases the number of days taken to reach the Maximum Infected Value. This is reflected by right-ward shift of the maxima of the Infected compartment, as well as a lower maxima value of the infected curve. The infected number increases until it reaches a global maxima, before decreasing as predicted by compartmental models of such form. This global maxima is termed as the Maximum Infected Value.

Impact of Delay in Implementing Mask Mandate\n\nBy applying SEIR models to the three scenarios outlined above, we can determine the Maximum Infected Values by simulating various delays in enforcing mask wearing. In Scenario 1, where there is full compliance with mask wearing and no time-limited immunity, different levels of delay in enforcing mask wearing were considered. Figure 3 illustrates the impact of enforcing mask wearing on (a) the day the first COVID-19 case was detected in Malaysia, (b) after a 50-day delay, (c) after a 100-day delay, and (d) not enforcing it at all. The results show that earlier implementation of mask wearing not only reduces the Maximum Infected Value but also prolongs the time taken to reach this peak.

Related Studies Juxtaposing our study against other similar studies that implement mathematical modelling on 'what-if' scenario based analysis, Eikenberry et al. [3] implemented a compartmentalized models for their simulations, and concluded that if the population remains unmasked until mask enforcement after some discrete delay, and that the level of adoption is fixed, the delay initially had little impact on the hospitalized fraction or deaths, but states that a 'point of no return' can be crossed. While this study yields similar results to ours, it is contextualised in the US states of New York and Washington, whilst ours was conducted in the context of Singapore. Given the differences in epidemiological parameters, size and characteristics of these cities and Singapore, our study adds value in being a more accurate representation of smaller city states. Furthermore, this study did not take into consideration newer, more infectious strains of the virus such as the B117 variant and time-limited immunity, which we have considered in our study.

This necessitates a high level of adherence to public health interventions, including reducing transmission-effective contacts and enforcing quarantine measures.

With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation. It shows that longer serial intervals induce greater reproduction numbers, and hence, more new infections, which further confirms that the epidemic may be more serious than what has been reported until now [15]. Based on the reported data, we have estimated that the ", "original_post_context": ", as of 22 January 2020. In comparison with the total population size of Wuhan, the effort of close contact tracing and quarantine was insufficient and appears to have a limited impact in terms of reducing the number of infected cases and/or slowing down the epidemic. The contour plot of R_c = 1 gives the threshold values of contact rate and quarantine rate for a city to avoid an outbreak. This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to personal protective and public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts, separation and restriction during the quarantine. Such a high level of quarantine rate and reduction of contact is possible only when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction. A strict travel restriction to the city of Wuhan is expensive and resource-consuming, imposing a substantial challenge to the decision- and policy-makers and the city's resilience. Moreover, such a measure could only delay the transmission of the infectious disorder. ", "original_contents": "time: 22 january 2020; location: wuhan"}

The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig.\u00a03a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment. By the end of June 2021, only 37% of the Ontario population are susceptible, with the majority having received at least one dose of vaccine (Fig.\u00a03b,c). The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig.\u00a03d). These are the wild-type and Alpha-driven waves identified in Fig.\u00a02a and described above. The Alpha-driven infection peak accounts for 0.7% of the total population, but subsides as the vaccination effort accelerates. The infections are split approximately half-half between asymptomatic and symptomatic ones, with the majority unvaccinated (Fig.\u00a03d\u2013g). As the infection spreads, the recovered population also increases, to 7% of the population at the end of 2021 (Fig.\u00a03h).

Because dosing interval can vary greatly within the population, and because vaccine escape rate is not sufficiently well characterized, these two parameters were varied by 50%. The vaccine-related results suggest that among these three factors, an effective vaccine deployment (captured in \u03c91) is the key in combating a pandemic, and success may be achieved even by means of a less-than-ideal vaccine with higher escape rate (Fig.\u00a04). Since the predicted numbers of infections and deaths are substantially more sensitive to variations in \u03c91 than \u03c92, if vaccine supply is limited, prioritizing the first dose by lengthening the dosing interval would be advisable, as was done in Canada. In a second sensitivity analysis, we considered the full model that represents all three variants, using the baseline parameter values (Table\u00a0S1). Key model parameters were increased to determine the effects on the number of infections and deaths associated with each variant. In addition to parameters considered in the above analysis, we also considered two parameters that mediate VOC interactions: \u03b2X R, rate of infection of individuals with partial immunity from having recovered from a different variant, and \u03b7R, rate of loss of immunity due to infection. Some of these parameters have distinct values for each of the variants. Simulations were conducted by varying each of the parameter values for individual variants separately. Specifically, \u03b2X (X = W, A, or D), \u03c3X, \u03b1X, \u03b3X, and \u03c91 were increased by 5%, \u03bb by 10%, and \u03bcI, \u03b2X R was increased 4 folds to assess the V, and \u03c92 by 50%. \u03b2X Scientific Reports |         (2022) 12:2114  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 4 Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/", "original_contents": "time:  2020"}

As expected, changes in \u03bcW I are immediately reflected in the number of deaths. However, compared to other clinical features of SARS- CoV-2, the mortality rate has a relatively small effect on the infected population, since < 5% of them die (Fig.\u00a04).

Local stability in terms of the basic reproduction number Noting  that  the  two  last  equations  and  the  fifth  of  system (1) are uncoupled to the remaining equations of the system, we can easily obtain, by direct integration, the following analytical re- sults: \u23a7 \u23aa \u23a8 (cid:12) t A (t) = \u03ba (1 \u2212 \u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 ) 0 E(s ) ds (cid:14) (cid:13) (cid:12) (cid:12) t t ds + \u03b3r R (t) = \u03b3i I(s ) + P (s ) 0 H(s ) ds 0 (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) t t t 0 P (s ) ds + \u03b4 0 I(s ) ds + \u03b4p F (t) = \u03b4i 0 H(s ) ds. h \u23aa \u23a9 (5) Furthermore, since the total population size N is constant, one has S(t) = N \u2212 [ E(t) + I(t) + P (t) + A (t) + H(t) + R (t) + F (t) ] . (6) Therefore,  the  local  stability  of  model  (1)  can  be  studied through the remaining coupled system of state variables, namely, the variables E, I, P , and H in (1) . The Jacobian matrix associated to these variables of (1) is the following one: J M = \u03b2 \u23a1 \u2212\u03ba \u23a2 \u23a3 \u03ba\u03c11  \u2212(cid:7) i \u03ba\u03c12 0 \u03b3a 0 i , \u03d6p , and \u03d6 l\u03b2 0 \u2212(cid:7) p \u03b3a \u23a4 \u23a5 \u23a6 , \u03b2 (cid:3) 0 0 \u2212(cid:7) h where \u03d6 trix J M are the roots of the following characteristic polynomial: Z(\u03bb) = \u03bb4 + a 1 \u03bb3 + a 2 \u03bb2 + a 1 \u03bb + a 4 , h are defined in (3) .

Main text Methods In  the  study,  a  mathematical  model  of  the  spread  and transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  was  formulated.  We  consider  two  interacting  populations,  the  human  population  as  hosts  and  the  pathogens.

The  pathogen  in  the  environment  is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in  two  ways,  namely:  human  to  human  and  environment to human. The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomatic  IA(t)  and  symptomatic  IS(t)  infected individuals  spread  the  COVID-19  virus  to  susceptible persons  S(t)  with  whom  they  are  in  close  contact.  In addition,  when  infected  individuals  sneeze  or  cough, without  taking  the  necessary  precautions,  the  virus spreads to the environment they are in. Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented. In  the  process  of  disease  spread,  the  susceptible  individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5].

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities.

Conclusions: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei.

We can do a similar analysis using stage I data of Wuhan. The stage I data is informative for predicting the epidemic trend assuming no rigorous quarantine and control measures. The first 10 daily data points (from Jan 20) were used to infer the parameters. The rest data points were used to test the performance of the model (Fig. 1C, D). As clearly seen in Fig. 1C, the predicted numbers of C\u00f0t\u00de and I\u00f0t\u00de increase dramatically, which are far beyond the observed numbers after Jan 21. The number of total infected can be as large as 8,923,823, and the epidemic lasts for a much longer time (328 days, see Table 1). The dramatic difference between predictions from stage I and Shilei Zhao and Hua Chen stage II data indicates the preventing measures and quarantines, such as travel restrict, are very efficient in controlling the outburst of the epidemic. Since more strict quarantine and traffic control measures were executed recently to inhibit the infection of COVID-19 in Wuhan and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 12, we also analyzed the stage III data (from Feb 13).

As we will show, a lack of data poses a more significant challenge for modelers. A crucial factor that contributes to the variation in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) aligns with the model's projections. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who sought medical attention, were tested, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed through DNA or imaging tests. In transmission models, the infected compartment encompasses all infected individuals, regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms, have been in contact with healthcare facilities, have confirmed test results, or have been misdiagnosed. Therefore, confirmed cases (data) represent only a portion of the total infected population (model predictions). A fitting analogy for this distinction is that of an iceberg, where the entire iceberg symbolizes the complete infected population, with the tip above the water representing the confirmed cases. The submerged portion of the iceberg signifies the infected individuals who are not detected through public health surveillance and testing, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2021, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2021).\n\nWhy is this a concern for modelers? When calibrating a model to estimate important parameters like the transmission rate b, it is essential to adjust the model output by discounting the total number of infectious individuals, I(t), by the case-infection ratio r in order to accurately predict confirmed case data. By trying out different values of r, a corresponding transmission rate b can be determined by matching the model to actual data, ultimately influencing the basic reproduction number R0, the size of the epidemic, and the peak timing. Due to the wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b varies widely, leading to a broad spectrum of model predictions. This variability, known in the modeling literature as nonidentifiability, complicates the process of accurately determining model parameters based on available data. Different combinations of r and b may fit the data well but result in divergent predictions about the epidemic. How nonidentifiability is addressed during model calibration significantly impacts the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method may struggle with detecting or resolving this issue due to its basic optimization algorithm, which aims to find a global minimum of the objective function but may encounter many different equally valid minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ", "original_post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

The value of \u03b2 is influenced by the type of contact when considering realistic network structures including households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts. Default transmission probabilities for different contact types are approximately 0.050 for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community, with relative weightings of 10:2:2:1. These values were selected to align with time-use surveys and previous studies on infections with known contact types. When considering factors such as age-based susceptibility and number of contacts in each layer, transmission events are estimated to occur roughly 30% in households, 25% in workplaces, 15% in schools, and 30% in the community in an unmitigated scenario. Interventions such as physical distancing can alter the value of \u03b2. Additionally, individual infectiousness can vary based on disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and individual viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u201358]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The daily viral load is utilized to adjust the per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an individual on a specific day. Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals under default parameter values are depicted in Fig 2. The distribution of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the situation; estimated proportions for Seattle can be found in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced if the infected person does not show symptoms [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not lower, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted as necessary based on the modeling application or situation, acknowledging that some studies have suggested significantly lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals given default parameter values are shown in Fig 2. The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
