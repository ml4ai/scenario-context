(2021), the researchers examined the impact of various interventions on the progression of an epidemic, including changes in the number of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. The simulation began with a social network with different layers and initial infection probabilities. The infection started at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spread in daily iterations over 300 days. In an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, the initial infection probability was set to \u03b2 < 1 to mimic natural social distancing practices. This included reducing physical contact and taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. The researchers observed that this initial value of \u03b2 better reflected the Argentinian pandemic. After 27 days, a moderate quarantine was imposed to simulate the measures implemented by most Argentinian states on March 24. During this quarantine, certain layers, such as religious activities and schools, were removed, and contacts in transportation and work were reduced to 30% of their initial value (\u03b2 = 0.09). Essential services and activities that continued with precautions were maintained. The researchers analyzed the impact of the \u03b2 parameter on the epidemic curve and found that higher infection rates led to faster disease spread but also quicker natural immunization of recovered individuals.4.1.

In our analysis, we assumed a fixed isolation level similar to the early days after government decrees in Argentina, but data indicates that these levels are constantly changing. As a result, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may be higher than those reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). Regarding daily death tolls, the average numbers predicted by the model are higher than official figures, likely due to underdetection rates and limited testing. An examination of death numbers in Argentina from January 1 to April 30 reveals a significant increase after February 26, the date of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Argentina, suggesting that the actual death toll may be considerably higher than reported. Moving forward, we consider four potential actions to take after 90 days (May 26): maintain current isolation levels, return to normal activities, resume only work activities, or increase isolation by halting work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312", "original_pre_context": "eiva et al.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2.

Results and Discussion 6.1. Dynamics of Delay of Compulsory Mask Wearing Upon applying the SEIR models to the 3 scenarios described in the above sections, we are able to obtain Maximum Infected Values by simulating different values of delay in mask enforcement. Considering the most basic case of Scenario 1; where there is complete compliance throughout the duration of mask enforcement, and the absence of time-limited immunity, Figure 3 shows the cases where mask wearing were to be enforced (a) on the day the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Singapore; (b) after a 50 days delay; (c) after a 100 days delay; and (d) not enforced at all. From Figure 3, it can be deduced that earlier enforcement of mask wearing both reduces the Maximum Infected Value as well as increases the number of days taken to reach the Maximum Infected Value. This is reflected by right-ward shift of the maxima of the Infected compartment, as well as a lower maxima value of the infected curve. The infected number increases until it reaches a global maxima, before decreasing as predicted by compartmental models of such form. This global maxima is termed as the Maximum Infected Value. For the case of (a) 0 days of delay in mask enforcement, the maximum infected value is approximately 10.453%, and the peak occurs at day 291 after the first case was detected.

Related Studies Juxtaposing our study against other similar studies that implement mathematical modelling on 'what-if' scenario based analysis, Eikenberry et al. [3] implemented a compartmentalized models for their simulations, and concluded that if the population remains unmasked until mask enforcement after some discrete delay, and that the level of adoption is fixed, the delay initially had little impact on the hospitalized fraction or deaths, but states that a 'point of no return' can be crossed. While this study yields similar results to ours, it is contextualised in the US states of New York and Washington, whilst ours was conducted in the context of Singapore. Given the differences in epidemiological parameters, size and characteristics of these cities and Singapore, our study adds value in being a more accurate representation of smaller city states. Furthermore, this study did not take into consideration newer, more infectious strains of the virus such as the B117 variant and time-limited immunity, which we have considered in our study.

Introduction Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family of Coronaviridae [1]. They cause generally mild respiratory infections, even though they are occasionally lethal. Since their discovery and first characterization in 1965 [2], three major, large-scale outbreaks have occurred, caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely, the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS) outbreak in 2003 in mainland China [3], the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [4,5] and the MERS outbreak in 2015 in South J.

At that time, 11\u00a0K would have died from COVID, with 36, 47, and 17% from wild type, Alpha, and Delta, respectively (Fig.\u00a02d). The year-end infection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750\u00a0K infections and 10.2\u00a0K deaths)16. Predicted population dynamics are shown in Fig.\u00a03. The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig.\u00a03a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment. By the end of June 2021, only 37% of the Ontario population are susceptible, with the majority having received at least one dose of vaccine (Fig.\u00a03b,c). The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig.\u00a03d). These are the wild-type and Alpha-driven waves identified in Fig.\u00a02a and described above. The Alpha-driven infection peak accounts for 0.7% of the total population, but subsides as the vaccination effort accelerates. The infections are split approximately half-half between asymptomatic and symptomatic ones, with the majority unvaccinated (Fig.\u00a03d\u2013g). As the infection spreads, the recovered population also increases, to 7% of the population at the end of 2021 (Fig.\u00a03h). These dynamics are summarized as fractions of the population that are susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered, as shown in Fig.\u00a03i. Sensitivity analysis.

What if a larger fraction of the vaccines were AstraZeneca, as is the case in the  UK18. A notable difference between the two vaccine types is that the Pfizer vaccine offers stronger protection than AstraZeneca against all COVID variants, especially Delta, after either one or two doses. For instance, an individual having received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine is 88% protected against the Delta variant, whereas with the AstraZeneca vaccine the protection is only at 60%19. We conduct a simulation in which only 40% of the vaccines are Pfizer. With a larger portion of the vaccinated population now under reduced vaccine protection, the spread of the VOC is substantially accelerated. By the end of 2021, the model predicts", "original_post_context": ", more than three times higher than the baseline prediction of 234 new Delta infections a day (Fig.\u00a07a). The total number of Delta infections and related deaths are also significantly higher, predicted to be 62\u00a0K and 882 at the end of 2021, respectively, compared to baseline values of 39\u00a0K and 689 (Fig.\u00a07b,d). If the provincial vaccination rate were lower, such that by September 1 2021 only 67% of the population are vaccinated with at least one dose, compared to the baseline vaccinated percentage of 74% (Fig.\u00a07c), the total number of Delta infections and deaths would increase by 75% by the end of March 2022; see Fig.\u00a07b,d. Beginning mid-June 2021, Ontario began to gradually reopen, with in-person classes set to resume in September. The baseline model assumes that the NPI that remain will still reduce COVID-19 infectivity by 60%. What if that assumption is overly optimistic? Indeed, it is not uncommon to experience pandemic fatigue and crave personal interactions; also, there may be outbreaks in schools. Thus, we consider a scenario with less stringent NPI starting from the fall of 2021 (September 1 2021), with \u03bb increased from its baseline value of 0.4 Scientific Reports |         (2022) 12:2114  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 7 Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/", "original_contents": "time:end of 2021"}

For instance, the WHO has estimated a reproduction number of 1.4e2.5, Li and colleagues (Li et al., 2020) have computed a slightly higher value of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.9), while in several other mathematical models which have been so far devised and released as pre-prints or undergone peer-review and published, the reproduction number varies from 1.3 to 4.7.

This means that the data follows a distribution with a mean based on the assumed model and a variance based on the assumed probability distribution, which may be influenced by the mean. Lack of data poses a significant challenge for modelers, as it affects the accuracy of model predictions. One key factor influencing the variability in predictions is the comparison between available data (confirmed cases) and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with COVID-19 symptoms who have been tested and confirmed, while the infected compartment in transmission models represents all infected individuals, including those with or without symptoms and those who have not been tested. The concept of confirmed cases being just a fraction of the total infected population is likened to an iceberg, where the tip above the water surface represents data and the submerged portion represents the hidden epidemic of undetected infections.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirmed cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

When calibrating a model to estimate key parameters like the transmission rate b by fitting it to confirmed cases data, it is essential to adjust for the total number of infectious individuals I(t) from the model prediction using the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed cases. Each value of r corresponds to a different transmission rate b, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R0 and the scale and timing of the epidemic. Due to the wide range of potential values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b can vary widely, leading to a range of model predictions. This nonidentifiability, where different parameter combinations can fit the data equally well but produce different predictions, poses challenges in model calibration. Addressing nonidentifiability in the calibration process is crucial for ensuring the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is ineffective in detecting or addressing this issue, as it relies on basic optimization algorithms that may find multiple global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ", "original_post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

It is important to differentiate between the latent period (time from infection to infectiousness) and the incubation period (time from infection to symptom onset). For SARS, individuals become infectious around two days after symptoms appear, showing that the latent period is longer than the incubation period. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus before showing symptoms, but the duration of the latent period is unclear. Although the SEIR model is more realistic biologically than the SIR model, it requires additional parameters such as the latent period and initial latent population.

In the SEIR model, a latent compartment E is added to denote the individuals who are infected but not infectious. The latency of COVID-19 infection is biologically realistic due to an incubation period as long as 14 days; newly infected individuals may not be infectious while the virus is incubating in the body. Here we note the difference between the latent period, which is the period from the time an individual is infected to the time the individual is infectious, and the incubation period, which is the period between the time an individual is infected to the time clinical symptoms appear, which include fever and coughing for COVID-19. For SARS, infected individuals become infectious on average two days after the onset of symptoms WHO (2003); so, the SARS latent period is on average longer than the incubation period. For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020), but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population. The transfer diagrams for both models are shown in Fig. 1. The biological meaning of all model parameters are given in Table 1 and Table 2. A key assumption in both models is that deaths occurring in the S, E, and I compartments are negligible during the period of model predictions. (4 months).

If a realistic network structure is included (such as households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts), the value of \u03b2 will vary depending on the type of contact. Default transmission probabilities are approximately 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values are determined based on a relative weighting of 10:2:2:1, chosen for consistency with time-use surveys and previous studies.

Individual infectiousness can also vary based on disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and individual viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u201358]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The distribution of transmissions from asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the situation, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in a study referenced [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmission is reduced when the infected individual is asymptomatic [55]. While our default assumption is that it is not lower, we include a parameter that can be adjusted based on the modeling scenario or context, acknowledging that some research has suggested significantly lower infectiousness rates among asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
