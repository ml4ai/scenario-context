The nodes are people and do not change across layers, and the weighted connections represent social contact which may lead to infection according to the edge weight (probability value within [0, 1)). The first layer represents home interactions and is composed of a set of groups with varying sizes, which are fully connected internally. These groups have no external connections, i.e., the network starts with disconnected components representing each family. To create each group, we consider the Brazilian family size distribution for 2010 [22], the year with more detailed information on family sizes from 1 up to 14 members. We consider the probability of a family having sizes from 1 to 10. Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1.

A large fraction of the population in any country need to work or practice some kind of economic activity, which means interacting with other people. Thus, work represents one of the most important factors of social relations, which is also very important in an epidemic scenario. To represent the work activity, we propose a generic layer to connect people with ages from 18 to 59 years, i.e., 60% of the total population in the case of Brazil. There is a wide variety of jobs and companies, therefore it is not trivial to create a connection rule that precisely reflects the real world. Here, we consider a common scenario with random groups of sizes around [5, 30], uniformly distributed, and internally connected (such as the ''home'' layer). An example of this layer is shown on Fig. 2(b), using n = 100. Although the nodes of a group are fully connected, the transmission of the virus depends directly on the edge weights, which we discuss in-depth on Section 3.1.1. Collective transports are essential in most cities but are among the most crowded environments and play an important role in an epidemic scenario due to the possibility of geographical spread, as vehicles are constantly moving around. The third layer we propose represents these public transports that include people who do not possess or use a personal vehicle. In Brazil the number of people using public transport depends on the size of the city, with 64.98% in the capitals and 35.89% in other cities [23], with an average use of around 1.2 h a day.1 Here we consider the average of the population between the two cases (50%), randomly sampled, to participate in the ''transports'' layer.

The study considers an optimistic scenario in which individuals are aware of the virus from the start, leading to a lower initial infection probability (\u03b2 < 1) due to natural social distancing practices. After 27 days, a moderate quarantine is implemented to simulate measures taken by Argentinian states like Buenos Aires on March 24.

This could lead to higher numbers of cases and deaths in future simulations (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). The average daily death toll in our models is higher than official figures, likely due to underdetection rates and limited testing. Analysis of deaths in Argentina from January to April indicate a significant rise after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on February 26, suggesting the actual death toll may be much higher than reported.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

The model achieves a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation. The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2. Future actions and its impacts After the initial epidemic phase, we consider four possible actions that can be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) Do nothing more, maintaining the current isolation levels; b) Stop isolation, returning activities to normal (initial network layers and weights); c) Return only work activities, restoring the initial probability of the layer; or d) Increase isolation, stopping the remaining activities in work and transport", "original_contents": "location: brazil; time: may 18"}

In Scenario 1, where there is full compliance with mask wearing and no time-limited immunity, simulations were done to determine the Maximum Infected Values for different delays in mask enforcement. The results showed that earlier enforcement of mask wearing not only reduces the Maximum Infected Value but also lengthens the time taken to reach it.

At the time this work was conducted, the number of deaths in Singapore was 26, and the total number of Recovered and Dead compartments was 40,625. \u03c1 = 1/9: As this number varies greatly across different demographics and is highly unpredictable, we are unable to obtain a proper average. Moreover, owing to the low numbers of COVID-19 deaths in Singapore, it would be inaccurate to calculate an average using this small sample size. Thus, for analysis purposes, we set it at 9 days. 6. Results and Discussion 6.1. Dynamics of Delay of Compulsory Mask Wearing Upon applying the SEIR models to the 3 scenarios described in the above sections, we are able to obtain Maximum Infected Values by simulating different values of delay in mask enforcement. Considering the most basic case of Scenario 1; where there is complete compliance throughout the duration of mask enforcement, and the absence of time-limited immunity, Figure 3 shows the cases where mask wearing were to be enforced (a) on the day the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Singapore; (b) after a 50 days delay; (c) after a 100 days delay; and (d) not enforced at all. From Figure 3, it can be deduced that earlier enforcement of mask wearing both reduces the Maximum Infected Value as well as increases the number of days taken to reach the Maximum Infected Value. This is reflected by right-ward shift of the maxima of the Infected compartment, as well as a lower maxima value of the infected curve. The infected number increases until it reaches a global maxima, before decreasing as predicted by compartmental models of such form. This global maxima is termed as the Maximum Infected Value.

Related Studies Juxtaposing our study against other similar studies that implement mathematical modelling on 'what-if' scenario based analysis, Eikenberry et al. [3] implemented a compartmentalized models for their simulations, and concluded that if the population remains unmasked until mask enforcement after some discrete delay, and that the level of adoption is fixed, the delay initially had little impact on the hospitalized fraction or deaths, but states that a 'point of no return' can be crossed. While this study yields similar results to ours, it is contextualised in the US states of New York and Washington, whilst ours was conducted in the context of Singapore. Given the differences in epidemiological parameters, size and characteristics of these cities and Singapore, our study adds value in being a more accurate representation of smaller city states. Furthermore, this study did not take into consideration newer, more infectious strains of the virus such as the B117 variant and time-limited immunity, which we have considered in our study.

They cause generally mild respiratory infections, even though they are occasionally lethal. Since their discovery and first characterization in 1965 [2], three major, large-scale outbreaks have occurred, caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely, the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS) outbreak in 2003 in mainland China [3], the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [4,5] and the MERS outbreak in 2015 in South J.

Simulation The population of Wuhan is around 11,081,000 inhabitants [18], hence, we set S(0) = 11, 081, 000. As of 10 January 2020, two patients had been recovered and were subsequently discharged from the hospital leading to R(0) = 2, and 739 individuals were quarantined leading to Sq(0) = 739. We set H(0) = 1, corresponding to the reported confirmed case on 10 January 2020. The quarantined individuals were isolated for 14 days, thus \u03bb = 1/14. According to the WHO [24], the incubation period of 2019-nCoV is about 7 days, hence \u03c3 = 1/7. 3. Results 3.1.

This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to personal protective and public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts, separation and restriction during the quarantine. Such a high level of quarantine rate and reduction of contact is possible only when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction.

It is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 January 2020, as shown in Table 4. Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to our model, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value. Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision- and policy-makers. The rather high reproduction number suggests that the outbreak may be more serious than what has been reported so far, given the particular season of increasing social contacts, warranting effective, strict public health measures aimed to mitigate the burden generated by the spreading of the new virus.

We began by elevating transmission rates in our model by a factor of 2.5 to account for the Delta variant. We added parameters to account for the effectiveness of vaccines against 1) transmission and 2) susceptibility to infection. We modeled 95% of the Cornell student population as vaccinated, a level that was later exceeded once newly arriving international students were vaccinated. Significant changes had occurred since previous semesters: Social distancing restrictions had been lifted, prevalence outside the campus had changed, contact tracing faced a larger number of contacts per trace (meaning less attention can be paid to each contact), and asymptomatic vaccinated close contacts were no longer required to quarantine. This created uncertainty in several parameters: transmission rates within and from outside campus, and the number of cases quarantined or isolated per initiated contact trace. We placed a (joint) prior on these parameters, sampled parameters from that prior, ran simulations at each parameter set, and updated the prior to a posterior; see Methods F and SI Appendix, section 4.

The rate of vaccination also influences the spread of the disease, although to a lesser extent. In contrast, the dosing interval (\u03c92) and vaccine escape rate (\u03b2W V) have smaller effects. These parameters were varied by 50% due to the wide variability of dosing intervals in the population and the lack of detailed information on vaccine escape rates. The findings related to vaccines indicate that effective deployment of the vaccine (captured in \u03c91) is crucial in fighting a pandemic, suggesting that success can be achieved even with a less optimal vaccine that has a higher escape rate (Fig. 4). Given that variations in \u03c91 impact predicted infections and deaths more significantly than \u03c92, if vaccine supply is limited, it may be wise to prioritize the first dose by extending the dosing interval, as seen in Canada.

Small variations in these four parameters (5%) result in changes in the number of infections and deaths that are an order of magnitude larger; see Fig.\u00a04. COVID-19 mortality rate \u03bcW I affects the number of infected individuals who are alive and can participate in the spread of the disease. Because COVID-19 mortality rate can vary substantially depending on health care infrastructure, we varied \u03bcW I by 50%. As expected, changes in \u03bcW I are immediately reflected in the number of deaths. However, compared to other clinical features of SARS- CoV-2, the mortality rate has a relatively small effect on the infected population, since < 5% of them die (Fig.\u00a04). Provincial policy and pharmaceutical interventions that were considered include NPI that reduce the effective disease infectivity (via scaling by \u03bb), vaccination rate (\u03c91), delay between the first and second vaccine doses (\u03c92,PZ and \u03c92,AZ, varied simultaneously), and vaccine escape rate (\u03b2W V). \u03bb and \u03c91 are varied by 5%.

Since the predicted numbers of infections and deaths are substantially more sensitive to variations in \u03c91 than \u03c92, if vaccine supply is limited, prioritizing the first dose by lengthening the dosing interval would be advisable, as was done in Canada. In a second sensitivity analysis, we considered the full model that represents all three variants, using the baseline parameter values (Table\u00a0S1). Key model parameters were increased to determine the effects on the number of infections and deaths associated with each variant.

Main text Methods In  the  study,  a  mathematical  model  of  the  spread  and transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  was  formulated.

Therefore, for the human population, N(t) equals S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Research has shown that COVID-19 can be spread through human-to-human contact as well as from the environment to humans. Both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) individuals infected with the virus can transmit it to susceptible persons (S(t)) they come into close contact with.

This variance may be dependent on the mean, highlighting the importance of understanding the relationship between available data, such as confirmed cases, and model predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been tested and received a positive result for COVID-19, while the infected compartment in transmission models includes all infected individuals, regardless of symptoms or testing status. This discrepancy between confirmed cases and total infected population can be likened to an iceberg, with confirmed cases representing the visible tip above the surface, while the hidden population beneath the water symbolizes those unknown to public health surveillance and testing, often referred to as the hidden epidemic.\n\nThe difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirmed cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 1789e1790, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 1790).\n\nWhy is this a concern for modelers? When calibrating a model, it is necessary to adjust the transmission rate b by the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed case data. This process allows for the estimation of key model parameters and the basic reproduction number R0, determining the scale and peak time of the epidemic. However, the wide range of potential values for the case-infection ratio r in relation to the transmission rate b can lead to a wide range of model predictions, known as nonidentifiability. This issue arises when different combinations of parameter values can yield similar fits to the data, resulting in significantly different predictions. Addressing nonidentifiability in the model calibration process is crucial for improving the reliability of model predictions. Traditional methods like nonlinear least squares may not effectively detect or resolve this issue, as they rely on basic optimization algorithms that may struggle to find the global minimum of the objective function. As a result, developing more sophisticated approaches to address nonidentifiability is essential for enhancing the accuracy of model predictions.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ", "original_post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

If a realistic network structure (including households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is considered, the value of \u03b2 will vary depending on the type of contact. The default transmission probabilities are approximately 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values were chosen to maintain a relative weighting of 10:2:2:1, aligning with time-use surveys and previous studies on infections with known contact types. In a typical transmission scenario without interventions, around 30% of transmission events occur through households, 25% through workplaces, 15% through schools, and 30% through the community. The value of \u03b2 can be adjusted through interventions like physical distancing. We also account for variations in individual infectiousness by allowing differences in disease severity, time spent in each disease state, and individual viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load for each agent is drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean 1.0 and shape ", "post_context": ", which was the value most consistent with both international estimates [59,60] and fits to data in Olympia state and Washington. The daily viral load is utilized to adjust the per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an agent on a specific day. Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals with default parameter values are illustrated in Fig 2. The distribution of transmissions from asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary based on the situation; estimated distributions for Seattle are referenced in [25]. There is conflicting evidence on whether transmissibility is reduced if the infected individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our initial assumption is that it is not, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted as necessary for different modeling scenarios or contexts, recognizing that some studies have suggested lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

The daily viral load is used to adjust the per-contact transmission probability (\u03b2) for an agent on a given day. Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals given default parameter values are shown in Fig 2. The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
