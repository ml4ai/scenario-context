The infection started at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree and spread over daily iterations up to 300 days. The researchers considered an optimistic scenario where individuals were aware of the virus from the start, resulting in an initial infection probability of \u03b2 < 1, reflecting natural social distancing and preventive measures. The study found that this initial \u03b2 value produced results more closely aligned with the Argentinian pandemic data. A moderate quarantine was implemented after 27 days, mimicking measures enforced by Argentinian states like Buenos Aires on March 24. During this quarantine period, certain activities were restricted, and contacts on transports and at workplaces were reduced to 30% of their initial level (\u03b2 = 0.09). The study analyzed how the \u03b2 parameter affected the overall epidemic trend, with higher infection rates leading to quicker spread of the disease but also resulting in faster natural immunization of recovered individuals.4.1.

Our analysis assumes a fixed isolation level similar to what was observed in the early days after government decrees in Argentina. However, data suggests that isolation levels are constantly changing, indicating that the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in future simulations may exceed those reported in this paper (refer to the \"keep isolation\" scenario in the next section). Regarding daily death tolls, the average number from our model is higher than official figures, likely due to higher underdetection rates and fewer tests being conducted. A comparison of death numbers in Argentina from January 1 to April 30 in 2019 and 2020 (shown in Fig. 5) reveals a clear upward trend starting on February 26, the day of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Argentina. This suggests that the actual death toll may be significantly higher than reported.\n\nLooking ahead after the initial stage of the epidemic, we consider four potential actions to be taken after 90 days (by May 26): maintain current isolation levels without changes; lift isolation measures and return to normal activities (initial network layers and weights); only resume work activities while maintaining initial layer probabilities; or increase isolation by halting remaining work and transport activities.", "original": "3f4c4a7e576c5ecddf76ccc26731f312", "original_pre_context": "eiva et al.

The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5.

It was observed that earlier enforcement of mask-wearing led to a decrease in the Maximum Infected Value and an increase in the number of days to reach this maximum.

Related Studies Juxtaposing our study against other similar studies that implement mathematical modelling on 'what-if' scenario based analysis, Eikenberry et al. [3] implemented a compartmentalized models for their simulations, and concluded that if the population remains unmasked until mask enforcement after some discrete delay, and that the level of adoption is fixed, the delay initially had little impact on the hospitalized fraction or deaths, but states that a 'point of no return' can be crossed. While this study yields similar results to ours, it is contextualised in the US states of New York and Washington, whilst ours was conducted in the context of Singapore. Given the differences in epidemiological parameters, size and characteristics of these cities and Singapore, our study adds value in being a more accurate representation of smaller city states. Furthermore, this study did not take into consideration newer, more infectious strains of the virus such as the B117 variant and time-limited immunity, which we have considered in our study.

Introduction Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family of Coronaviridae [1]. They cause generally mild respiratory infections, even though they are occasionally lethal. Since their discovery and first characterization in 1965 [2], three major, large-scale outbreaks have occurred, caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely, the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS) outbreak in 2003 in mainland China [3], the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [4,5] and the MERS outbreak in 2015 in South J.

This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to personal protective and public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts, separation and restriction during the quarantine. Such a high level of quarantine rate and reduction of contact is possible only when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction. A strict travel restriction to the city of Wuhan is expensive and resource-consuming, imposing a substantial challenge to the decision- and policy-makers and the city's resilience. Moreover, such a measure could only delay the transmission of the infectious disorder. ", "original_contents": "time: 22 january 2020; location: wuhan"}

The year-end infection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750\u00a0K infections and 10.2\u00a0K deaths)16. Predicted population dynamics are shown in Fig.\u00a03. The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig.\u00a03a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment. By the end of June 2021, only 37% of the Ontario population are susceptible, with the majority having received at least one dose of vaccine (Fig.\u00a03b,c). The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig.\u00a03d). These are the wild-type and Alpha-driven waves identified in Fig.\u00a02a and described above. The Alpha-driven infection peak accounts for 0.7% of the total population, but subsides as the vaccination effort accelerates. The infections are split approximately half-half between asymptomatic and symptomatic ones, with the majority unvaccinated (Fig.\u00a03d\u2013g). As the infection spreads, the recovered population also increases, to 7% of the population at the end of 2021 (Fig.\u00a03h). These dynamics are summarized as fractions of the population that are susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered, as shown in Fig.\u00a03i. Sensitivity analysis.

Because COVID-19 mortality rate can vary substantially depending on health care infrastructure, we varied \u03bcW I by 50%. As expected, changes in \u03bcW I are immediately reflected in the number of deaths. However, compared to other clinical features of SARS- CoV-2, the mortality rate has a relatively small effect on the infected population, since < 5% of them die (Fig.\u00a04). Provincial policy and pharmaceutical interventions that were considered include NPI that reduce the effective disease infectivity (via scaling by \u03bb), vaccination rate (\u03c91), delay between the first and second vaccine doses (\u03c92,PZ and \u03c92,AZ, varied simultaneously), and vaccine escape rate (\u03b2W V). \u03bb and \u03c91 are varied by 5%. Since NPI are modelled by scaling \u03b2W directly, they have large effects on model predictions (Fig.\u00a04). Vaccination rate has lesser but still significant effects on the spread of the disease. The effects of dosing interval (\u03c92) and ", "original_post_context": " are much smaller. Because dosing interval can vary greatly within the population, and because vaccine escape rate is not sufficiently well characterized, these two parameters were varied by 50%. The vaccine-related results suggest that among these three factors, an effective vaccine deployment (captured in \u03c91) is the key in combating a pandemic, and success may be achieved even by means of a less-than-ideal vaccine with higher escape rate (Fig.\u00a04). Since the predicted numbers of infections and deaths are substantially more sensitive to variations in \u03c91 than \u03c92, if vaccine supply is limited, prioritizing the first dose by lengthening the dosing interval would be advisable, as was done in Canada. In a second sensitivity analysis, we considered the full model that represents all three variants, using the baseline parameter values (Table\u00a0S1). Key model parameters were increased to determine the effects on the number of infections and deaths associated with each variant. In addition to parameters considered in the above analysis, we also considered two parameters that mediate VOC interactions: \u03b2X R, rate of infection of individuals with partial immunity from having recovered from a different variant, and \u03b7R, rate of loss of immunity due to infection. Some of these parameters have distinct values for each of the variants. Simulations were conducted by varying each of the parameter values for individual variants separately. Specifically, \u03b2X (X = W, A, or D), \u03c3X, \u03b1X, \u03b3X, and \u03c91 were increased by 5%, \u03bb by 10%, and \u03bcI, \u03b2X R was increased 4 folds to assess the V, and \u03c92 by 50%. \u03b2X Scientific Reports |         (2022) 12:2114  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 4 Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/", "original_contents": "time:  2020"}

Main text Methods In  the  study,  a  mathematical  model  of  the  spread  and transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  was  formulated.  We  consider  two  interacting  populations,  the  human  population  as  hosts  and  the  pathogens.  The  model  subdivides the  total  human  population  size  at  time  t  denoted  as N(t)  into  susceptible  S(t),  exposed  E(t),  asymptomatic infectious  IA(t) ,  symptomatic  infectious  IS(t)  and  the recovered  as  R(t).  The  pathogen  in  the  environment  is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in  two  ways,  namely:  human  to  human  and  environment to human. The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomatic  IA(t)  and  symptomatic  IS(t)  infected individuals  spread  the  COVID-19  virus  to  susceptible persons  S(t)  with  whom  they  are  in  close  contact.  In addition,  when  infected  individuals  sneeze  or  cough, without  taking  the  necessary  precautions,  the  virus spreads to the environment they are in. Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented. In  the  process  of  disease  spread,  the  susceptible  individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5]. The exposed individual  moves  to  either  asymptomatic  IA(t)  or  symptomatic  IS(t)  infectious  population.

A similar analysis can be conducted using the early-stage data from Chengdu to predict the epidemic trend in the absence of strict quarantine measures. The model was calibrated using the first 10 daily data points from January 20, with the subsequent data points used to validate the model's performance (see Figure 1C, D).

This rate is crucial in modeling the dynamics of an infectious disease and the impact of artificial factors on its control. We established a set of ODE equations to capture this dynamic (Eq.1). In the model, infected individuals either directly transition to confirmed cases or indirectly through quarantine. By considering the latter as a special case with no delay during the quarantine to confirmation process, we simplified the model to Eq.2. Parameters such as the mean waiting time from quarantine to confirmation (T = 1/g1) and the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation (w = 1/[g2 \u00f01 \u2013 g2 \u00de]) offer valuable insights into monitoring and predicting disease trends. The reproductive number of the infection is denoted as R = \u03b1/g1. Parameter inference in the model typically relies on data of the cumulative confirmed infections (C\u00f0t\u00de) for model fitting and parameter estimation. The initial number of susceptible individuals (S\u00f00\u00de) is assumed to be equal to the population size, while the initial confirmed infections (C\u00f00\u00de) are obtained from official reports. Note that the initial time of the ODE system does not have to be at the beginning of the epidemic, and can start from any time point during the break of COVID-19.

During this time period, confirmed infection numbers may provide a more accurate depiction of the natural progression of COVID-19, as opposed to the early stages before Feb 20 when numbers were low and fluctuating due to strict quarantine measures. The accurate estimation of the parameter \u03b1 is challenging, with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 when estimated using different methods or data sets. However, in the SUQC model, an exact value of \u03b1 is not crucial, as the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R = \u03b1/g1 is sensitive to parameter optimization. The bias of \u03b1 can be balanced out by g1. Various free parameters and initial values, such as g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de, and Q \u00f00\u00de, are estimated by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model. The expected daily time series of confirmed infections, denoted as ^C, is calculated using the model's Eq. 2 and solved with the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The loss function, err \u00f0\u03b1,g1,U0,Q0 \u00de = jjC - ^Cjj 2 (3), is then optimized using the interior point method in MATLAB's fmincon function to infer the parameter values.

Some parameters can be calculated beforehand using the public data directly. We calculate the infection rate \u03b1 using the confirmed infected numbers of Wuhan city during Jan 20 and Jan 27. By fitting an exponential curve, we get ", "original_post_context": ". Confirmed infected numbers during this time interval may be less biased and represent natural character of COVID-19, while confirmed numbers are small and fluctuating at early stages before Jan 20 and are affected by strict quarantine measures in later stages. The parameter \u03b1 is hard to estimate accurately. The values estimated by using different methods or different data sets range from 0.3 to 0.5 [9\u201311]. Luckily in SUQC an accurate value of \u03b1 is not necessary; the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=\u03b1=g1 as a compound parameter is sensitive in parameter optimization, and thus the bias of \u03b1 can be balanced by g1. Other free parameters and initial values, including g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de and Q\u00f00\u00de, are estimated by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model. Denote ^C=f \u00f0g1,\u03b2,U0,Q0\u00de as the expected daily time series of confirmed infections provided by the model (Eq. 2), which was solved by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with given values of g1, \u03b2, U \u00f00\u00de and Q\u00f00\u00de.

We try different initial values in parameter optimization, and notice that the inferred parameter values are not sensitive to the provided initial values. Note that the loss function (Eq. 3) may give too much weight to later observations since the cumulative case numbers are higher than earlier days.

The lack of data is a significant concern for modelers. An important factor that can explain variations in model predictions is understanding the relationship between available data (confirmed cases) and the model's predictions. Confirmed cases pertain to individuals with symptoms who have sought medical attention, undergone testing, and had their COVID-19 infection confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all individuals who have been infected, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, and includes those with confirmed tests as well as those who may have been misdiagnosed. Therefore, confirmed cases (data) represent only a portion of the total infected population (model predictions). This discrepancy can be likened to an iceberg, where the entire structure represents the total infected population and the visible tip above the water symbolizes the confirmed cases. The submerged portion of the iceberg represents the infected individuals not captured by public health surveillance and testing, known as the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019, the ", "post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2019). Why is this problematic for modelers? When calibrating a model to estimate key parameters like the transmission rate b by matching output to confirmed cases data, it's necessary to adjust the total number of infectious people, I(t), in the model prediction by the case-infection ratio r to accurately predict confirmed cases. By varying the ratio r, the transmission rate b can be estimated to determine the basic reproduction number R0, the scale of the epidemic, and peak time. Due to the wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio r of COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b also varies widely, resulting in a range of model predictions. This nonidentifiability issue in modeling means that different combinations of r and b can fit the data well but lead to very different epidemic predictions. Addressing nonidentifiability in model calibration significantly impacts the reliability of predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method may not effectively detect or address this issue, as it relies on simple optimization algorithms that are limited in finding the best objective function minimum among many global minima.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ", "original_post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

If a realistic network structure is considered, including households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts, the value of \u03b2 will vary based on the type of contact. The default transmission probabilities are around 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values were chosen with relative weightings of 10:2:2:1 to align with time-use surveys and studies on infections with known contact types, and to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population. When combined with other factors such as age-based susceptibility and the default number of contacts in each layer, the proportions of transmission events in an unmitigated scenario are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. \u03b2 can be adjusted by interventions like physical distancing. We also account for variations in individual infectiousness by considering differences in viral load. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

Fig 2 displays viral loads for a sample of individuals with default parameter values. The distribution of transmissions among asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals can vary depending on the circumstances, with estimated proportions for Seattle provided in [25]. Studies have conflicting findings on whether transmission is reduced if the infectious individual is asymptomatic [55]. Our default assumption is that it is not, but we include a parameter that can be adjusted according to the modeling application or context, acknowledging that some research has suggested lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage.

Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals given default parameter values are shown in Fig 2. The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
