The study utilized a social network model with initial infection probabilities, starting at a node with a degree closest to the average network degree.

Physica A 564 (2021) 125498 the effects of different actions on the overall epidemic picture, such as the increase and reduction of cases, deaths, and occupied beds in hospitals. The social network starts with all its layers and the original infection probabilities. The infection begins at a node with the closest degree to the average network degree and propagates at iterations of 1 day (up to 300 days). We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is \u03b2 < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of \u03b2 yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., \u03b2 = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting the quarantine. Under this scenario, we first analyze how the \u03b2 parameter impacts the overall epidemic shape. Fig. 4(a) shows results for 4 \u03b2 values in function of daily new cases and deaths, iterating from up to 300 days after the first infection. As higher the infection rates, faster is the disease spreading and the final number of cases and deaths. On the other hand, the epidemic ends faster due to natural immunization of recovered nodes. 4.1.

The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2.

To model the gradual noncompliance of universal masking, we make a modification to Equation (9). m(t) = \u03b2s \u2212 \u03b2c 1 + e\u2212k1(\u2212t+t0) + \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2nc 1 + e\u2212k2(\u2212t+t1) + \u03b2nc (10) As individuals began to engage in noncompliance out of complacency and pandemic fatigue, the infection rate, \u03b2nc, would thus increase slightly. Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy.

The results show that earlier enforcement of mask wearing not only reduces the Maximum Infected Value but also prolongs the time taken to reach this maximum.

This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to personal protective and public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts, separation and restriction during the quarantine. Such a high level of quarantine rate and reduction of contact is possible only when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction. A strict travel restriction to the city of Wuhan is expensive and resource-consuming, imposing a substantial challenge to the decision- and policy-makers and the city's resilience. Moreover, such a measure could only delay the transmission of the infectious disorder. ", "original_contents": "time: 22 january 2020; location: wuhan"}

More  than  47%  of  the  confirmed  COVID-19  cases  in  Ohio  were concentrated  in  only  five  counties  included  in  Group  1  (Cuyahoga, Franklin, Lucas, Montgomery and Summit), with an average infection rate of 274 cases per 100,000 people. These counties are characterized by a high population density, with 35% of the total population of the state residing in these five counties, but they are also local air hubs with airports that receive more than 10,000,000 passengers every year. The high connectivity and travelers in these counties generated by airports can produce a high influx of locally imported infections that boost the local transmission of the virus in the county and consequently accelerate the spread of the infection in these areas (Organization, 2020; Warren et al., 2010). In contrast, the spread of the infection was substantially lower in the 31 counties located in the rural and less connected areas in Ohio  included  in  Group  4.  Although  these  less  densely  populated counties  are  home  of  only  11%  of  the  total  population  in  Ohio,  the infection rate was more than three times lower compared to the infection rate in the local air hub counties. We also identified marked differences in the geographical distribution of the critical healthcare capacity of the state. More than 50% of the total number of ICU beds available are in the five counties included in Group 1 with a rate of 22 ICU beds per 100,000 people.

Partially based on the findings of Imai and coworkers (Imai et al., 2020) and building on a SIR model, Yu (Yu, 2020) has computed a basic reproduction number of 3.5 and has estimated that only a quarantine rate of infectious population higher than 90% would enable to effectively control the coronavirus outbreak. Kucharski and colleagues (Kucharski et al., 2020) designed a stochastic SEIR model, based on the Euler-Maruyama algorithm with a 6-h time-step and with the transmission rate following a geometric Brownian motion. Time-varying reproduction number was estimated using the sequential Monte-Carlo approach. Authors utilized several datasets to overcome the issue of unreliability of some data sources and to provide real-time estimates, relying on the Poisson probability calculation. Transmission was modeled as a random process, fluctuating and varying over the time. Similar to the model of Imai and coworkers (Imai et al., 2020), the risk of transmission and the risk of causing a large outbreak were modeled based on a negative binomial offspring distribution, with incubation and infectious period being Erlang distributed.

(6) Therefore,  the  local  stability  of  model  (1)  can  be  studied through the remaining coupled system of state variables, namely, the variables E, I, P , and H in (1) .

Similar to the simple SIR model, shielding alone has the potential to reduce the burden of an epidemic by decreasing the total impact and shortening the peak event. In a population of 10,000,000 for a high-transmission scenario, the final epidemic predictions show 71,000 deaths in the baseline case, 58,000 deaths with intermediate shielding, and 20,000 deaths with enhanced shielding. In a population of the same size for a low-transmission scenario, the final epidemic predictions are 50,000 deaths in the baseline case, 34,000 deaths with intermediate shielding, and 8,300 deaths with enhanced shielding. The majority of deaths occur in individuals aged 60 years and older, even though they make up a smaller portion of the population. Our analysis focuses on the impact of shielding alone, while ongoing restrictions such as social distancing will further reduce interaction rates. The effectiveness of shielding depends on the number of potential shields identified and their substitutability, denoted as \u03b1Rshields. Population-scale effects of shielding are influenced by demographic distributions, the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, and the duration of immunity.

Figure 3 shows the results of comparing shielding interventions to the baseline outbreak. As in  the  simple  SIR  model,  shielding  on  its  own  could  potentially decrease epidemic burden across multiple metrics, decreasing both the total impact and shortening the peak event. In a population of size  10,000,000  for  the  high-transmission  scenario,  the  final  epidemic predictions are 71,000 deaths in the baseline case compared with 58,000 deaths given intermediate shielding (\u03b1 = 2) and 20,000 deaths  given  enhanced  shielding  (\u03b1 = 20).  In  a  population  of  size 10,000,000  for  the  low-transmission  scenario,  the  final  epidemic predictions from our model are 50,000 deaths in the baseline case compared  with  34,000  deaths  given  intermediate  shielding  and 8,300 deaths given enhanced shielding.

Our simulation results consider effects of shielding  alone,  whereas  ongoing  restrictions,  such  as  social  distancing and shelter-in-place orders, will help to further reduce interaction rates.

Using the inferred parameters, we have also generated long-term predictions for the numbers of total infected (I), unquarantined infected (U), quarantined infected (Q), and cumulative confirmed infections (C) in Hubei Province, China, as shown in Fig. 1A.

While a lack of data is a significant concern for modellers, one key issue influencing model predictions is how the available data of confirmed cases aligns with these predictions. Confirmed cases refer to individuals with symptoms who have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19, while the infected compartment in transmission models encompasses all individuals who are infected, whether symptomatic or not, and may or may not have confirmed tests. This distinction between confirmed cases (data) and model predictions is likened to an iceberg, with the tip above the surface representing data and the bulk hidden beneath symbolizing the unknown portion of the infected population - a concept known as the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

When calibrating a model to estimate important parameters like the transmission rate (b) by comparing model output to confirmed cases data, it is crucial to adjust for the total number of infectious people (I(t)) in the model prediction using the case-infection ratio (r) to accurately predict confirmed cases. By varying the ratio r, different values for the transmission rate b can be calculated to determine the basic reproduction number (R0), epidemic scale, and peak time. Due to the wide range of possible values for the case-infection ratio r in COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range as well, leading to a variety of model predictions. This variability, known as nonidentifiability in modeling literature, means that multiple combinations of r and b can fit the data well but produce vastly different epidemic predictions. How nonidentifiability is handled in model calibration significantly impacts the reliability of predictions. Traditional nonlinear least squares methods may struggle to address nonidentifiability since they use basic optimization algorithms that aim to find a global minimum of the objective function, resulting in many possible solutions.", "original": "6ad54314d847d091c657c33a7c32203b", "original_pre_context": " already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ", "original_post_context": ", based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima g", "original_contents": "time: 2019, 2020"}

In the SEIR model, a latent compartment known as E represents individuals who are infected but not yet infectious. This concept is biologically realistic, as COVID-19 has an incubation period of up to 14 days during which newly infected individuals may not be infectious. It is important to distinguish between the latent period, which is the time from infection to infectiousness, and the incubation period, which is the time from infection to symptom onset. For SARS, individuals become infectious around two days after symptoms appear, leading to a longer average latent period compared to the incubation period. Evidence suggests that individuals with COVID-19 can be infectious before showing symptoms, though the length of the latent period remains unknown. The SEIR model is more realistic biologically than the SIR model, but it requires additional parameters: the latent period and initial latent population. The differential equations for both models are shown in Figure 1, with detailed parameter meanings in Table 1 and Table 2. Both models assume that deaths in the S, E, and I compartments are negligible during the predictive period (4 months). The models are calibrated using newly confirmed case data, matching the rI term in both models, with deaths in the R compartment having no impact on fitting. The equations for both models are given as follows: S' = \u03b2IS, I' = \u03b2IS - (r + m)I, R' = rI, E' = \u03b2IS - \u03b5E, I' = \u03b5E - (r + m)I, R' = rI.

Here we note the difference between the latent period, which is the period from the time an individual is infected to the time the individual is infectious, and the incubation period, which is the period between the time an individual is infected to the time clinical symptoms appear, which include fever and coughing for COVID-19. For SARS, infected individuals become infectious on average two days after the onset of symptoms WHO (2003); so, the SARS latent period is on average longer than the incubation period. For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020), but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population.

Without interventions, the distribution of transmission events is roughly 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. Interventions like physical distancing can modify the value of \u03b2. Additionally, individuals can vary in disease severity, time spent in each state, and infectiousness, with individual viral load used to model differences in infectivity. Several studies have found that viral load is highest around or slightly before symptom onset, and then falls monotonically [54\u2013 58]. As a simple approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter.

Our default assumption is that it is not, but we allow for adjustments based on the modeling scenario or setting, acknowledging that some studies have suggested lower infectiousness rates for asymptomatic individuals [61].", "original": "de511590b83629d5349be5a6c93d9a2e", "original_pre_context": "2]. Hence, this parameter must be calibrated by the user to match local epidemic data, as described in Section 2.6.8. If realistic network structure (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and community contacts) is included, the value of \u03b2 depends on the contact type. Default transmission probabilities are roughly 0.050 per contact per day for households, 0.010 for workplaces and schools, and 0.005 for the community. These values correspond to relative weightings of 10:2:2:1, chosen (a) for consistency with both time-use surveys [53] and studies of infections with known contact types [47], and (b) to have a weighted mean close to the default \u03b2 value of 0.016 for a well-mixed population (i.e., if different network layers are not used). When combined with the default number of contacts in each layer, age-based susceptibility, and other factors, for a typical (unmitigated) transmission scenario, the proportions of transmission events that occur in each contact layer in the absence of interventions are approximately 30% via households, 25% via workplaces, 15% via schools, and 30% via the community. The value of \u03b2 can also be modified by interventions, such as physical distancing, as described below. In addition to allowing individuals to differ in terms of disease severity and time spent in each disease state, we allow individual infectiousness to vary between people and over time. We use individual viral load to model these differences in infectivity.

Viral loads for a representative sample of individuals given default parameter values are shown in Fig 2. The proportion of transmissions by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals varies by context; estimated proportions for Seattle are shown in [25]. Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals [61].
