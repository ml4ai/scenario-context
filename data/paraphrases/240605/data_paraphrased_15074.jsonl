It was then assumed that the new virus would result in a greater number of mild to moderate cases compared to SARS, leading to a reproduction number estimate of 2.0, with a range of uncertainty between 1.4 and 2.3. Furthermore, the researchers determined that only public health measures that could block more than 60% of transmission would effectively manage and curtail the spread of the coronavirus. Building upon the research by Imai and colleagues (Imai et al., 2020) and utilizing a SIR model, Yu (Yu, 2020) calculated a basic reproduction number of 3.5, concluding that a quarantine rate for the infectious population exceeding 90% would be necessary to effectively control the outbreak. In a similar vein, Kucharski and his team (Kucharski et al., 2020) developed a stochastic SEIR model based on the Euler-Maruyama method with a 6-hour interval, where the transmission rate was modeled with geometric Brownian motion. The time-varying reproduction number was derived through a sequential Monte-Carlo method. By leveraging multiple datasets to address data reliability concerns, authors were able to provide real-time estimates by applying the Poisson probability theory. Transmission dynamics were treated as a stochastic process with fluctuations and variations over time. Echoing the approach of Imai and his team (Imai et al., 2020), both the transmission risk and the potential for widespread infection were based on a negative binomial offspring distribution, incorporating Erlang distributions for the incubation and infectious periods. The median reproduction number was reported to hover between 1.6 and 2.9 prior to the initiation of travel restrictions.The study by Wu and collaborators (Wu et al., 2020), based on nowcasting and forecasting approach, estimated a ", "post_context": "of 2.68 (95% credible interval or CrI 2.47e2.86) with 75,815 individuals (95% CrI 37,304e130,330) being infected in Chengdu as of January 25th, 2020.The study discovered that the doubling time of the epidemic was 6.4 days, within a 95% CrI of 5.8 to 7.1 days. Shen and his team's (Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020) dynamic transmission model forecasted 8,042 infections (95% CI 4,199 to 11,884) and 898 deaths (95% CI 368 to 1,429), indicating a fatality rate of 11.02% (95% CI 9.26 to 12.78%). The initial basic reproduction number was calculated to be 4.71 (95% CI 4.50 to 4.92), which was then reduced to 2.08 (95% CI 1.99 to 2.18) by January 22nd, 2020. According to these predictions, the outbreak of the pandemic is likely to diminish noticeably in 77 days (95% CI 75 to 80 days) from its onset. Moreover, the researchers concluded that shortening the period from the start of illness/symptoms to isolation by one day could lead to a 72 to 84% decrease in peak population size, and a 68 to 80% decrease in total number of infections and deaths. Majumder and Mandl (Majumder & Mandl, 2020), using the \u201cIncidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment\u201d (IDEA) model, suggested a reproduction number ranging from 2.0 to 3.1.

The epidemics doubling time was found to be 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8e7.1). The dynamics transmission\nmodel by Shen and coworkers (Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020) predicted 8042 (95% CI 4199e11,884) infections and 898\n(95% CI 368e1429) deaths, with a fatality rate of 11.02% (95% CI 9.26e12.78%). Authors computed a basic reproduction\nnumber of 4.71 (95% CI 4.50e4.92), which decreased to 2.08 (95% CI 1.99e2.18) on January 22nd, 2020. Based on these es-\ntimates, the pandemics outbreak is expected to signi\ufb01cantly decrease within 77 [95% CI 75e80] days from its beginning.\nFurthermore, authors found that every one-day reduction in the duration of the period from illness/symptom onset to\nisolation would reduce the peak population size by 72e84% and the cumulative infected cases and deaths both by 68e80%.\nThe study by Majumder and Mandl (Majumder & Mandl, 2020) utilized the \u201cIncidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment\u201d\n(IDEA) model and led to an estimate of the reproduction number in the range of 2.0e3.1. Finally, Riou and Althaus (Riou &\nAlthaus, 2020), using a stochastic model simulating epidemics trajectories, computed a reproduction number of 2.2 (90%\nhigh density interval 1.4e3.8). Using statistical approaches, namely exponential growth and maximum likelihood techniques,\nLiu and colleagues (Liu et al., 2020) estimated the value of the reproduction number ranging from 2.90 (95% CI 2.32e3.63) to\n2.92 (95% CI 2.28e3.67).

It is evident that there is a pressing necessity for a simulation model that can accurately predict the outcomes of various policy decisions on both the spread of diseases and the availability of healthcare resources in specific areas. It is crucial to highlight, and thereby avoid, policies that, when assessed on scientific grounds, are inferior to alternatives and thus ought not to be enacted. We developed a model named REINA that is based on an agent framework, programmed in Python, and optimized for performance via the Cython static compiler. This model simulates the trajectory of a population over time, tracking individuals through different phases of a disease. It projects the load on hospital and intensive care units, calculates mortality rates, and accounts for available treatments. The model allows for the integration of various intervention strategies at any point in time, including but not limited to, social distancing measures, testing and contact tracing, and managing the influx of cases from outside the region. REINA is open-source and accessible online. The performance of the model was evaluated by analyzing the effectiveness of different intervention strategies on controlling the outbreak and relieving pressure on healthcare systems. One scenario demonstrated that without aggressive measures, simply restricting movement can slow, but not adequately control, the spread, thereby overburding hospital resources. Another scenario showed the benefits of not only implementing movement restriction but also undertaking extensive testing, tracing, and isolation of individuals testing positive for coronavirus and their close contacts.

These end-of-year estimates for infections and fatalities are within 10% of the actual figures reported in Ontario (750,000 infections and 10,200 deaths). Figure 3 outlines the predicted demographic shifts. After the start of 2021, a noticeable reduction occurs in the number of individuals susceptible to the virus (Fig. 3a), mainly due to vaccination efforts. By June 2021, barely 37% of the Ontario populace remained vulnerable, with the vast majority having been vaccinated with at least one dose (Fig. 3b,c).The number of", "post_context": " at the start of 2021, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig.\u00a03d).The identified waves, categorized as wild-type and Alpha-driven, are outlined in Fig. 2a and have been previously discussed.

Infections are roughly divided equally between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, predominantly among those who are unvaccinated (refer to Fig. 3d\u2013g). As the outbreak continues, there is an increase in the number of individuals who have recovered, reaching 7% of the population by the end of 2021 (see Fig. 3h).

Our analysis involved estimating several parameters such as the hazard rate within each spatial risk group, the rate of infection transmission among different groups, rates of hospitalization, hospital discharge, ICU admissions, recovery from ICU, and mortality within each group. This model accounted for the influence of preventative public health measures like social distancing and the implementation of stay-at-home orders in Ohio, which altered the disease's spread at certain times. To achieve this, we employed a nonlinear least-square data fitting approach using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm (Lagarias et al., 1998) aimed at reducing the discrepancies between observed data and the model's forecasts.

This method enhances the conventional SIR model and has been utilized to analyze the progression of the outbreak in Colombia, considering data until 05/26/2020. It also explores the impact of potential future interventions and their outcomes. The network model describes the epidemic through statistics on infections, fatalities, and the duration of hospital stays. Modifications to the network, such as removing layers or diminishing the strength of social interactions, simulate the effects of isolation, social distancing, and other preventive measures.Results show that even taking\nvarious optimistic assumptions, the current isolation levels in Colombia still may lead to\na", "post_context": " (average of\n149,000).Should activities resume as usual, we might witness a sharp rise in epidemic growth, resulting in the need for ICU beds to exceed the nation's capacity by threefold.

Enhancing isolation measures, up to implementing a lockdown, appears to be the most effective strategy to maintain demands within the healthcare system's limits.

Initially, we examine the effects on daily new cases and fatalities, with findings presented in Figure 6.

This led to the identification of only the severe and critical infections for testing, alongside 20% of mild cases. We later address the overall infection rate.

COVID-19 features several unique properties not seen in other infectious diseases, such as high virulence during the incubation period, a lag between the actual dynamics and the daily reported case counts, and the impact of quarantine and control strategies. Methods: To better understand COVID-19's spread, we designed a Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model. This model takes into account the effects of control interventions, offering a more fitting analysis approach compared to previous models. Results: We utilized this model to examine the COVID-19 outbreak data in Hanoi, the rest of northern provinces excluding Hanoi, other regions in Vietnam excluding northern provinces, and four major cities in Vietnam. Our findings reveal that until January 30, 2020, each of these areas, besides Hanoi, had a reproductive number (R) greater than 1. Post-January 30, the R number dropped below 1 across all regions, suggesting the efficacy of the containment and control measures. According to our model, Hanoi's confirmation rate was 0.0643, notably lower than that of northern provinces excluding Hanoi (0.1914), and the rest of Vietnam excluding northern provinces (0.2189), though it increased to 0.3229 after February 12 due to changes in diagnostic criteria incorporating clinical evidence.

Around 80,511 people in Vietnam are estimated to have been infected, with 49,510 in Hanoi, 17,679 from the rest of northern provinces, and 13,322 from other areas excluding northern provinces. These numbers are based on a deterministic ODE model, implying they come with inherent uncertainties. Conclusions: Our analysis advocates for the continuation of strict quarantine and control measures through early March in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and Can Tho, and until late March in northern provinces.

On February 12, 2020, the estimated number of non-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan was 3,509, dropping to 334 by February 21, 2020. According to the model, updated with data up to February 21, 2020, it is predicted that COVID-19 will conclude around late March in Wuhan and Hubei, by mid-March for Shanghai, and before the start of March 2020 for the four major cities.

COVID-19 exhibits several unique features distinct from other infectious diseases, including the high potential for infection during its incubation period, a lag in the detection of actual case numbers compared to daily reported cases, and varying impacts from the quarantine and other control measures that have been implemented. Methods: To better understand the spread of COVID-19 and assess the effectiveness of control measures, we introduced a model known as the Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model. This model offers a more accurate framework for analysis compared to other epidemic models by incorporating the outcomes of intervention strategies. Results: Utilizing this SUQC model with data on confirmed cases, we analyzed the COVID-19 outbreak in several regions including Wuhan, the rest of Henan, China province excluding Wuhan, other parts of China excluding Henan, China, and in four major cities. Our findings reveal that, up until January 30, 2020, all the analyzed regions, with the exception of Tianjin, China, showed a reproductive number (R) greater than 1. Post-January 30, the R value dropped below 1 in all regions, indicating the effectiveness of the introduced quarantine and control measures in curbing the virus spread. The detection rate in Wuhan as estimated by our model was 0.0643, significantly lower than Henan, China excluding Wuhan (0.1914) and the rest of China excluding Henan, China (0.2189). However, this rate increased to 0.3229 after February 12 following the integration of clinical evidence into the diagnostic criteria. The estimated number of un-quarantined cases in Wuhan was 3,509 on February 12, which then decreased to 334 by February 21. According to model predictions based on data up to February 21, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak is expected to conclude by Late February in Wuhan and Henan, China, by Late February in the broader Chinese territories excluding Henan, China, and before Late February 2020 in the four first-tier cities.
