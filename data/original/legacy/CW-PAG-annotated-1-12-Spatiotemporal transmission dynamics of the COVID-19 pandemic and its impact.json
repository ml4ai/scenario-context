Our aim  is  to  predict  the  spatiotemporal  dynamics  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  in  relation  with  the  distribution  of  the  capacity  of  healthcare in Ohio. 2. Methods 2.1. Mathematical model We developed a spatial mathematical model to simulate the transmission  dynamics  of  COVID-19  disease  infection  and  spread.  The spatially-explicit model incorporates geographic connectivity information at county level. The Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized-Recovered- Dead (SIHRD) COVID-19 model classified the population into susceptibles  (S),  confirmed  infections  (I),  hospitalized  and  ICU  admitted  (H), recovered (R) and dead (D). Based on a previous study that identified local air hubs and main roads as important geospatial attributes linked to  differential  COVID-19  related  hospitalizations  and  mortality  (Correa-Agudelo et al., 2020; Cuadros et al., 2020), we stratified the SIHRD COVID-19 model into four different spatial risk groups based on defined connectivity index for each county. The spatial risk groups were defined as follows, Group 1: counties with airports with more than 50,000 passengers  per  year;  Group  2:  counties  surrounding  the  counties  with  airports; Group 3: counties with main highways crossing the county; and Group 4: counties  not  surrounding  counties  with  airports  or  being  crossed  by  main highways. The dynamics of disease transmission and infection progression  in  each  group  were  modeled  using  seven  epidemiological  compartments  for  the  SIHRD  COVID-19  model  (Fig.  S1).  Susceptible individuals  in  each  spatial  group  were  at  risk  of  being  exposed  to infection at varying hazard rates, which are group- and time dependent, to capture the variability in the risk of exposure and the impact of public health interventions. A detailed description of the model is given in the Supplementary Materials. 2.2. Model fitting and parameterization ",

Since we were interested in simulating COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the general population, we excluded data from Marion and Pickaway counties, which experienced  unusual  confined  and  explosive  COVID-19  outbreaks.  Marion Correctional  Institution  is  the  site  of  one  the  biggest  COVID-19  outbreaks  in  Ohio,  driving  the  Marion  County  to  the  highest  rate  of COVID-19  cases  in  the  state.

The underlying causes of these regional differences in the country are currently not well understood.  Preliminary  studies  have  identified  socioeconomic  (e.g higher  population of ethnic minorities), health-related (e.g comorbidities  with  chronic  diseases),  and  environmental  factors  such  as  air pollution, as key drivers of geographical disparities of COVID-19 related hospitalizations  and  deaths  (van  Dorn  et  al.,  2020;  Wu  et  al.,  2020; COVID, 2020). In a previous study we found that the spatial distribution of these factors along with other spatial attributes such as airport and road connectivity were linked to the geospatial disparities of COVID-19 related risk of mortality in the U.S (Correa-Agudelo et al., 2020). Understanding the local variation in disease transmission dynamics under heterogeneous geospatial attributes is a crucial step in developing more effective strategies for mitigating risk of infection in vulnerable communities.  Therefore,  in  this  study,  we  built  a  spatially-explicit mathematical  model  to  predict  the  county-level  spatial  dynamics  of COVID-19 epidemic in a region. The model was calibrated using data from the state of Ohio in the U.S. Ohio is one of the few states producing detailed daily reports of COVID-19 confirmed cases, COVID-19 related cumulative hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths per county. Likewise, Ohio is a state with marked variation of demographic  and  geographic  attributes  among  counties  along  with substantial differences in the capacity of healthcare within the state.

This is of high relevance  considering  the  unequal  distribution  of  the  capacity  of  the healthcare system, which might strongly determine disease outcomes (Ji et al., 2020). Regions across the U.S have not been equally affected by the  COVID-19  pandemic,  with  the  Northeastern  part  of  the  country reporting more cases and deaths (van Dorn et al., 2020). The underlying causes of these regional differences in the country are currently not well understood.  Preliminary  studies  have  identified  socioeconomic  (e.g higher  population of ethnic minorities), health-related (e.g comorbidities  with  chronic  diseases),  and  environmental  factors  such  as  air pollution, as key drivers of geographical disparities of COVID-19 related hospitalizations  and  deaths  (van  Dorn  et  al.,  2020;  Wu  et  al.,  2020; COVID, 2020). In a previous study we found that the spatial distribution of these factors along with other spatial attributes such as airport and road connectivity were linked to the geospatial disparities of COVID-19 related risk of mortality in the ",
    "post_context": " (Correa-Agudelo et al., 2020). Understanding the local variation in disease transmission dynamics under heterogeneous geospatial attributes is a crucial step in developing more effective strategies for mitigating risk of infection in vulnerable communities.  Therefore,  in  this  study,  we  built  a  spatially-explicit mathematical  model  to  predict  the  county-level  spatial  dynamics  of COVID-19 epidemic in a region. The model was calibrated using data from the state of Ohio in the U.S. Ohio is one of the few states producing detailed daily reports of COVID-19 confirmed cases, COVID-19 related cumulative hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths per county. Likewise, Ohio is a state with marked variation of demographic  and  geographic  attributes  among  counties  along  with substantial differences in the capacity of healthcare within the state. Our aim  is  to  predict  the  spatiotemporal  dynamics  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  in  relation  with  the  distribution  of  the  capacity  of  healthcare in Ohio. 2. Methods 2.1. Mathematical model We developed a spatial mathematical model to simulate the transmission  dynamics  of  COVID-19  disease  infection  and  spread.  The spatially-explicit model incorporates geographic connectivity information at county level. The Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized-Recovered- Dead (SIHRD) COVID-19 model classified the population into susceptibles  (S),  confirmed  infections  (I),  hospitalized  and  ICU  admitted  (H), recovered (R) and dead (D). Based on a previous study that identified local air hubs and main roads as important geospatial attributes linked to  differential  COVID-19  related  hospitalizations  and  mortality  (Correa-Agudelo et al., 2020; Cuadros et al., 2020), we stratified the SIHRD COVID-19 model into four different spatial risk groups based on defined connectivity index for each county. The spatial risk groups were defined as follows, Group 1: counties with airports with more than 50,000"

    "pre_context": "ht strongly determine disease outcomes (Ji et al., 2020). Regions across the U.S have not been equally affected by the  COVID-19  pandemic,  with  the  Northeastern  part  of  the  country reporting more cases and deaths (van Dorn et al., 2020). The underlying causes of these regional differences in the country are currently not well understood.  Preliminary  studies  have  identified  socioeconomic  (e.g higher  population of ethnic minorities), health-related (e.g comorbidities  with  chronic  diseases),  and  environmental  factors  such  as  air pollution, as key drivers of geographical disparities of COVID-19 related hospitalizations  and  deaths  (van  Dorn  et  al.,  2020;  Wu  et  al.,  2020; COVID, 2020). In a previous study we found that the spatial distribution of these factors along with other spatial attributes such as airport and road connectivity were linked to the geospatial disparities of COVID-19 related risk of mortality in the U.S (Correa-Agudelo et al., 2020). Understanding the local variation in disease transmission dynamics under heterogeneous geospatial attributes is a crucial step in developing more effective strategies for mitigating risk of infection in vulnerable communities.  Therefore,  in  this  study,  we  built  a  spatially-explicit mathematical  model  to  predict  the  county-level  spatial  dynamics  of COVID-19 epidemic in a region. The model was calibrated using data from the state of Ohio in the U.S. Ohio is one of the few states producing detailed daily reports of COVID-19 confirmed cases, COVID-19 related cumulative hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths per county. Likewise, Ohio is a state with marked variation of demographic  and  geographic  attributes  among  counties  along  with substantial differences in the capacity of healthcare within the state. Our aim  is  to  predict  the  spatiotemporal  dynamics  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  in  relation  with  the  distribution  of  the  capacity  of  healthcare in ",
    "post_context": ". 2. Methods 2.1. Mathematical model We developed a spatial mathematical model to simulate the transmission  dynamics  of  COVID-19  disease  infection  and  spread.  The spatially-explicit model incorporates geographic connectivity information at county level. The Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized-Recovered- Dead (SIHRD) COVID-19 model classified the population into susceptibles  (S),  confirmed  infections  (I),  hospitalized  and  ICU  admitted  (H), recovered (R) and dead (D). Based on a previous study that identified local air hubs and main roads as important geospatial attributes linked to  differential  COVID-19  related  hospitalizations  and  mortality  (Correa-Agudelo et al., 2020; Cuadros et al., 2020), we stratified the SIHRD COVID-19 model into four different spatial risk groups based on defined connectivity index for each county. The spatial risk groups were defined as follows, Group 1: counties with airports with more than 50,000 passengers  per  year;  Group  2:  counties  surrounding  the  counties  with  airports; Group 3: counties with main highways crossing the county; and Group 4: counties  not  surrounding  counties  with  airports  or  being  crossed  by  main highways. The dynamics of disease transmission and infection progression  in  each  group  were  modeled  using  seven  epidemiological  compartments  for  the  SIHRD  COVID-19  model  (Fig.  S1).  Susceptible individuals  in  each  spatial  group  were  at  risk  of  being  exposed  to infection at varying hazard rates, which are group- and time dependent, to capture the variability in the risk of exposure and the impact of public health interventions.

The dynamics of disease transmission and infection progression  in  each  group  were  modeled  using  seven  epidemiological  compartments  for  the  SIHRD  COVID-19  model  (Fig.  S1).  Susceptible individuals  in  each  spatial  group  were  at  risk  of  being  exposed  to infection at varying hazard rates, which are group- and time dependent, to capture the variability in the risk of exposure and the impact of public health interventions. A detailed description of the model is given in the Supplementary Materials. 2.2. Model fitting and parameterization We  used  data  from  the  Ohio  Department  of  Health  (Health  ODo, 2020). The model was fitted using the following data sets: 1) cumulative number  of  confirmed  COVID-19  cases,  2)  cumulative  number  of COVID-19-related  hospitalizations,  3)  cumulative  number  of  ICU  admissions, and 4) cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths in each county in  Ohio  from  March  51  to  May  10,  2020.  We  used  an  out-of-sample model  validation  approach  to  test  the  performance  of  the  model.  We withheld 20% of the data and conducted model fitting and parameterization using data from March 1 to April 25 as the estimation period, and data from April 26 to May 10 were used as the validation period to assess the accuracy of model estimates (Fig. S2). Since we were interested in simulating COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the general population, we excluded data from Marion and Pickaway counties, which experienced  unusual  confined  and  explosive  COVID-19  outbreaks.  Marion Correctional  Institution  is  the  site  of  one  the  biggest  COVID-19  outbreaks  in  Ohio,  driving  the  Marion  County  to  the  highest  rate  of COVID-19  cases  in  the  state.

The  model included  the  impact  of  public  health  interventions  such  as  social distancing and stay home order implemented in Ohio that changed the transmission dynamics of the disease at a specific time point.

We  conducted  a multivariable uncertainty analysis to determine the range of uncertainty around model predictions. We performed 10,000 simulation runs using a Latin Hypercube sampling from a multidimensional distribution of the model parameters, in which parameter values were selected from ranges specified by assuming �30% uncertainty around parameters' point estimates (Ayoub et al., 2020a, 2020b), and the resulting distributions of estimates across  all runs  were used  to calculate the  95%  Credible Intervals (Crls) of model estimations.

Understanding the local variation in disease transmission dynamics under heterogeneous geospatial attributes is a crucial step in developing more effective strategies for mitigating risk of infection in vulnerable communities.  Therefore,  in  this  study,  we  built  a  spatially-explicit mathematical  model  to  predict  the  county-level  spatial  dynamics  of COVID-19 epidemic in a region. The model was calibrated using data from the state of Ohio in the U.S. Ohio is one of the few states producing detailed daily reports of COVID-19 confirmed cases, COVID-19 related cumulative hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths per county. Likewise, Ohio is a state with marked variation of demographic  and  geographic  attributes  among  counties  along  with substantial differences in the capacity of healthcare within the state. Our aim  is  to  predict  the  spatiotemporal  dynamics  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  in  relation  with  the  distribution  of  the  capacity  of  healthcare in Ohio. 2. Methods 2.1.

Likewise,  the  model  estimated  4,318  (95%  Crl 3,807–5,937) cumulative hospitalizations, 1,362 (95% Clr 1,185–1,825) cumulative ICU admissions, and 1,529 (95% Crl 1,314–2,120) cumulative COVID-19 related deaths compared to 4,054 hospitalizations, 1,205 ICU admissions, and 1,421 deaths reported by May 10, 2020 in Ohio (Fig. 1). We found substantial variations  in the spread and intensity of the infection  among  the  different  spatial  risk  groups.  The  epidemic  was spreading faster and affecting more individuals in counties with local air hubs from Group 1, whereas the rural and less connected counties from Group  4  experienced  a  slower  and  less  severe  spread  of  the  disease (Fig. 2).

We found substantial variations  in the spread and intensity of the infection  among  the  different  spatial  risk  groups.  The  epidemic  was spreading faster and affecting more individuals in counties with local air hubs from Group 1, whereas the rural and less connected counties from Group  4  experienced  a  slower  and  less  severe  spread  of  the  disease (Fig. 2). The infection rate of COVID-19 was almost three times higher in Group 1, with an average of 274 cases per 100,000 people, compared to an  average  of  85  cases per  100,000  people in  the  rural  and  less  connected counties from Group 4,  with a hazard rate of  infection in this group  three-fold  smaller  relative  to  Group  1  (Fig.  2).  Similarly, cumulative  COVID-19  related  hospitalizations  were  twice  higher  in counties with local air hubs, with an average of 48 hospitalizations per 100,000  people,  compared  to  an  average  of  23  hospitalizations  per 100,000 people in the less connected counties from Group 4. Estimations  generated  using  the  non-spatial  adjusted  model  overestimated  COVID-19  infection  rate  in  the  rural  and  less  connected counties from Group 4, estimating an average of 185 cases per 100,000 inhabitants,  compared  to  the  actual  number  of  85  cases  per  100,000 people  in  these  counties.  Conversely,  this  model  underestimated  the infection rate in the local air hub counties (Group 1), with 176 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to the actual number of 247 cases per 100,000 people in these counties (Fig. 3).

Highly populated and connected counties with local air hubs from Group 1 had the highest  critical  healthcare  capacity,  with  22  ICU  beds  available  per 100,000  people,  whereas  the  rural  and  less  connected  counties  from Group 4 had, on average, nine ICU beds available per 100,000 people. Disease projections using the spatial model indicated that assuming a 50%  easing  of  social  distancing  intervention,  air  hub  counties  would reach 94% of the maximum ICU bed capacity in eight weeks after the intervention  is  relaxed.  Conversely,  the  rural  and  less  connected counties from Group 4 would reach 55% of the maximum ICU bed capacity eight weeks after the intervention is relaxed (Fig. 4). Critical care capacity  would  remain  stable  at  27%  of  the  maximum  capacity  if  no changes in the intervention are introduced. Fig. 1.

COVID-19 patients over the total number of ICU beds available in each county at one week, five weeks and eight weeks after the easing of social distancing intervention and also assuming a baseline scenario of maintaining  the  status  quo  of  the  current  social  distancing  interventions implemented  in  Ohio.  Results  were  displayed  in  maps  created  using ArcGIS® by ESRI version 10.5 (http://www.esri.com) (ESRI, 2004). 3. Results The  model  estimated  a  total  number  of  21,430  (95%  Crl 18,965–31,754)  COVID-19  cases  compared  to  the  20,763  confirmed cases (excluding Marion and Pickaway counties) reported by May 10, 2020  in  Ohio.  Likewise,  the  model  estimated  4,318  (95%  Crl 3,807–5,937) cumulative hospitalizations, 1,362 (95% Clr 1,185–1,825) cumulative ICU admissions, and 1,529 (95% Crl 1,314–2,120) cumulative COVID-19 related deaths compared to 4,054 hospitalizations, 1,205 ICU admissions, and 1,421 deaths reported by May 10, 2020 in ",
    "post_context": " (Fig. 1). We found substantial variations  in the spread and intensity of the infection  among  the  different  spatial  risk  groups.  The  epidemic  was spreading faster and affecting more individuals in counties with local air hubs from Group 1, whereas the rural and less connected counties from Group  4  experienced  a  slower  and  less  severe  spread  of  the  disease (Fig. 2). The infection rate of COVID-19 was almost three times higher in Group 1, with an average of 274 cases per 100,000 people, compared to an  average  of  85  cases per  100,000  people in  the  rural  and  less  connected counties from Group 4,  with a hazard rate of  infection in this group  three-fold  smaller  relative  to  Group  1  (Fig.  2).  Similarly, cumulative  COVID-19  related  hospitalizations  were  twice  higher  in counties with local air hubs, with an average of 48 hospitalizations per 100,000  people,  compared  to  an  average  of  23  hospitalizations  per 100,000 people in the less connected counties from Group 4. Estimations  generated  using  the  non-spatial  adjusted  model  overestimated  COVID-19  infection  rate  in  the  rural  and  less  connected counties from Group 4, estimating an average of 185 cases per 100,000 inhabitants,  compared  to  the  actual  number  of  85  cases  per  100,000 people  in  these  counties.  Conversely,  this  model  underestimated  the infection rate in the local air hub counties (Group 1), with 176 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to the actual number of 247 cases per 100,000 people in these counties (Fig. 3). Critical healthcare capacity measured as ICU beds available shows substantial disparities among counties in Ohio (Fig. S2). Highly populated and connected counties with local air hubs from Group 1 had the highest  critical  healthcare  capacity,  with  22  ICU  beds  available  per 100,000  people,  whereas  the  rural  and  less  connected  counties  from Group 4 had, on average, nine ICU beds available per 100,000 people.

The results showed substantial geographical variation in the dynamics of the disease with some local areas experiencing much faster and intensive spread of the infection compared to other areas. Counties in which the connectivity is enhanced by air transportation had faster spread  of  infection  compared  to  nearby  counties,  counties  with  high road connectivity, and more isolated rural counties in Ohio. The non- spatial  adjusted  model  showed  that  these  geographical  differences  in the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic among counties were not only generated by the uneven distribution of the population in the state but also  by  underlying  spatial  attributes  like  transport  connectivity  that might  introduce  substantial  variation  in  the  local  dynamics  of  the infection. More  than  47%  of  the  confirmed  COVID-19  cases  in  Ohio  were concentrated  in  only  five  counties  included  in  Group  1  (Cuyahoga, Franklin, Lucas, Montgomery and Summit), with an average infection rate of 274 cases per 100,000 people.

Discussion We assessed the geospatial variation of the spread of the novel SARS- CoV-2 virus in Ohio, U.S., and the impact of the differential spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease in the uneven critical healthcare capacity of the state. The results showed substantial geographical variation in the dynamics of the disease with some local areas experiencing much faster and intensive spread of the infection compared to other areas. Counties in which the connectivity is enhanced by air transportation had faster spread  of  infection  compared  to  nearby  counties,  counties  with  high road connectivity, and more isolated rural counties in Ohio. The non- spatial  adjusted  model  showed  that  these  geographical  differences  in the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic among counties were not only generated by the uneven distribution of the population in the state but also  by  underlying  spatial  attributes  like  transport  connectivity  that might  introduce  substantial  variation  in  the  local  dynamics  of  the infection.

The high connectivity and travelers in these counties generated by airports can produce a high influx of locally imported infections that boost the local transmission of the virus in the county and consequently accelerate the spread of the infection in these areas (Organization, 2020; Warren et al., 2010).

    "post_context": ".  These dynamic differences in disease transmission are induced not only by the uneven distribution of the population but also by spatial attributes such as the level of air and road connectivity in these areas. As a result, not all local areas are going to reach their maximum critical care capacity at the same time, and failure in the inclusion of geospatial attributes to understand the local disease dynamics can generate inaccurate estimations that are critical, also considering the uneven spatial distribution of the critical  healthcare  capacity  in  a  region.  Higher  disease  transmission intensity  experienced  in  some  highly  connected  and  urbanized  areas could  substantially  impact  the  critical  care  response  of  these  areas regardless  of  their  potentially  high  healthcare  capacity  compared  to their  more  rural  and  less  connected  counterparts  (Hall  et  al.,  2006; Hartley, 2004). Therefore, accounting for the spatially uneven disease diffusion linked to the geographical distribution of the critical care resources  is  key  in  developing  effective  prevention  and  control  programmes to contain COVID-19 pandemic (Graves, 2008; Yamashita and Kunkel,  2010).  This  is  particularly  important,  in  view  of  a  potential scenario in which intermittent lockdowns could become a future public health strategy to reduce challenges in the critical healthcare response for future pandemics.
