We have proposed a new model that predicts the evolution of epidemics and helps to assess the impact of different strategies to contain the spread of the infection, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracing. Testing is important because undetected infected people, most of whom are asymptomatic, largely sustain the epidemic spread. Several possible scenarios have been outlined. Under the less stringent lockdown conditions with limited testing, we predict that more than 70,000 people could die in Italy in the first year.

    "pre_context": "e have proposed a new model that predicts the evolution of epidemics and helps to assess the impact of different strategies to contain the spread of the infection, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracing. Testing is important because undetected infected people, most of whom are asymptomatic, largely sustain the epidemic spread. Several possible scenarios have been outlined. Under the less stringent lockdown conditions with limited testing, we predict that more than 70,000 people could die in Italy in the first year. However, if strict lockdown measures continue to be maintained and population-wide testing and contact tracing efforts are substantially increased, the number of deaths could potentially be limited to 25,000 people overall. As with all modeling studies, our predictions are based on reasonable assumptions, but the actual course of the epidemic heavily relies on how and when isolation and safety measures are implemented. Policy implications Our findings confirm that the adopted social-distancing measures are necessary and effective, and should be promptly enforced at the earliest stage. Lockdown measures can only be relieved safely in the presence of widespread testing and contact tracing. Combining lockdown and population-wide testing is key to rapidly ending the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model, named SIDARTHE, discriminates between detected and undetected cases of infection and between different severity of  illness (SOI), non-life-threatening cases (asymptomatic and pauci- symptomatic;  minor  and moderate infection)  and  potentially life- threatening cases (major and extreme) that require ICU admission. The  total  population  is  partitioned  into  eight  stages  of  disease:  S,  susceptible  (uninfected);  I,  infected  (asymptomatic  or pauci-symptomatic  infected,  undetected);  D,  diagnosed  (asymptomatic  infected,  detected);  A,  ailing  (symptomatic  infected, undetected);  R,  recognized  (symptomatic  infected,  detected);  ",

Our model, named SIDARTHE, discriminates between detected and undetected cases of infection and between different severity of  illness (SOI), non-life-threatening cases (asymptomatic and pauci- symptomatic;  minor  and moderate infection)  and  potentially life- threatening cases (major and extreme) that require ICU admission. The  total  population  is  partitioned  into  eight  stages  of  disease:  S,  susceptible  (uninfected);  I,  infected  (asymptomatic  or pauci-symptomatic  infected,  undetected);  D,  diagnosed  (asymptomatic  infected,  detected);  A,  ailing  (symptomatic  infected, undetected);  R,  recognized  (symptomatic  infected,  detected);  T, threatened  (infected  with  life-threatening  symptoms,  detected); H,  healed  (recovered);  E,  extinct  (dead).

    "post_context": " is on lockdown, extended emergency measures nationwide are being applied to contain the epidemic: unless indispensable for fundamental activities, people are forced to stay at home in family settings, drastically reducing the risk of spreading the disease. Person-to-person household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been described in China44,45. Although the infection of household members of COVID- 19-positive individuals is possible, the rate of this occurrence is difficult to estimate so far. The only way to completely avoid such risk is to separate infected individuals in dedicated quarantine centers46, as has been done partially in Italy, confining infected people in individual hotel rooms. Even with reduced admissions to hospital, patients that are treated at home and assisted by household members strictly comply with the home isolation guidelines issued by experts47, ranging from sanitary hygiene measures (including waste management, cleaning of contaminated surfaces and household laundering) to interhuman contact measures among family members (the caregiver of a suspected or confirmed COVID- 19-infected individual in home isolation must be in good health and maintain  a distance of at least 1 m, avoiding direct contact with oral or respiratory  secretions, faeces and urine; moreover, a surgical mask and disposable gloves should always be used). Hence, we can safely assume that in-house transmission  is severely limited. Although we do consider a delay in the emergence of symptoms, through asymptomatic (or pauci-symptomatic) patients, categorized as undetected (infected) and detected (diagnosed), our model does not account for a possible latency between exposure to the virus and onset of infectiousness, because there is mounting evidence that an infected individual can transmit the virus at an early, preclinical stage of the disease, based on epidemiological investigation of COVID-19 clusters45,48–50. Moreover, recent studies estimated median serial interval values for COVID-19 to be"

MERS-CoV reinfection despite serum detection of neutralizing antibodies has been described NAtuRe MeDICINe | www.nature.com/naturemedicine only in animals41,42, while the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum via primary infection or passive transfer has been shown to prevent respiratory tract replication of SARS-CoV in a murine model43. From a modeling perspective, we are particularly interested in predictions over a relatively short horizon within which the temporary immunity is likely still to be in place, and the possibility of reinfection would negligibly affect the total number of susceptible individuals and so there would be no substantial difference in the evolution of the epidemic curves we consider. To provide solid support to this claim, Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the results of numerical simulation of the model when the possibility of reinfection is introduced: the evolution is almost identical, with the only difference being that the recovered population of course decreases over time. Hence, based on the evidence at hand, although we cannot rule out that adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may not provide long-lasting protection, we may reasonably consider the probability of reinfection to be negligible within the scope of our model. Also, our model accounts for a distinction between non-diagnosed individuals, who spread the infection more because they are not in isolation, and diagnosed individuals, who transmit the disease much less thanks to proper isolation and complying with strict rules, either in hospital or at home. Because Italy is on lockdown, extended emergency measures nationwide are being applied to contain the epidemic: unless indispensable for fundamental activities, people are forced to stay at home in family settings, drastically reducing the risk of spreading the disease. Person-to-person household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been described in ",
    "post_context": "44,45. Although the infection of household members of COVID- 19-positive individuals is possible, the rate of this occurrence is difficult to estimate so far. The only way to completely avoid such risk is to separate infected individuals in dedicated quarantine centers46, as has been done partially in Italy, confining infected people in individual hotel rooms. Even with reduced admissions to hospital, patients that are treated at home and assisted by household members strictly comply with the home isolation guidelines issued by experts47, ranging from sanitary hygiene measures (including waste management, cleaning of contaminated surfaces and household laundering) to interhuman contact measures among family members (the caregiver of a suspected or confirmed COVID- 19-infected individual in home isolation must be in good health and maintain  a distance of at least 1 m, avoiding direct contact with oral or respiratory  secretions, faeces and urine; moreover, a surgical mask and disposable gloves should always be used). Hence, we can safely assume that in-house transmission  is severely limited. Although we do consider a delay in the emergence of symptoms, through asymptomatic (or pauci-symptomatic) patients, categorized as undetected (infected) and detected (diagnosed), our model does not account for a possible latency between exposure to the virus and onset of infectiousness, because there is mounting evidence that an infected individual can transmit the virus at an early, preclinical stage of the disease, based on epidemiological investigation of COVID-19 clusters45,48–50. Moreover, recent studies estimated median serial interval values for COVID-19 to be close to or shorter than the median incubation period51,52, further proving the possibility of presymptomatic transmission of the disease. For this reason, we deemed it unnecessary to include an additional stage: although asymptomatic, individuals exposed to the virus retain a potential of viral transmission and thus reasonably fit withi"

Perhaps more importantly, it can also be explained by the Italian criteria for (provisional) statistics, which lead to overestimation. In fact, unlike other countries, the official numbers for COVID-19 deaths provisionally include the deaths of all people tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even when they had multiple pre-existing life-threatening diseases and the exact cause of death had not yet been ascertained, so these numbers still need to be confirmed55. Thus, an important challenge in tuning the model is that the initial data are affected by statistical distortion: in particular, the values of the ratio death/infected are highly overestimated.

Perhaps more importantly, it can also be explained by the Italian criteria for (provisional) statistics, which lead to overestimation. In fact, unlike other countries, the official numbers for COVID-19 deaths provisionally include the deaths of all people tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even when they had multiple pre-existing life-threatening diseases and the exact cause of death had not yet been ascertained, so these numbers still need to be confirmed55. Thus, an important challenge in tuning the model is that the initial data are affected by statistical distortion: in particular, the values of the ratio death/infected are highly overestimated.

Due to this, R0 = 1.80. After day 22, the lockdown, at first incomplete, yields α = 0.360, β = δ = 0.005 and γ = 0.200; also, ζ = η = 0.034, μ = 0.008, ν = 0.015, λ = 0.08 and ρ = κ = ξ = σ = 0.017.

Thus, an important challenge in tuning the model is that the initial data are affected by statistical distortion: in particular, the values of the ratio death/infected are highly overestimated. The model fitting process must take this problem into account. Therefore, we decided to fit the parameters based on the data about the diagnosed infected population and the number of recovered diagnosed patients, but not on the data about deaths. It is also worth stressing that, in the long run, the model is weakly sensitive to the initial conditions; for this reason, the initial mismatch concerning the mortality data has little impact. We adopt a best-fit approach to find the parameters that locally minimize the sum of the squares of the errors. The model involves many state variables, as well as a large number of uncertain parameters whose numerical determination is a very challenging problem; it is likely that an infinite number of different parameter sets could be found, matching the data equally well.

The resulting basic reproduction number is R0 = 2.38. After day 4, as a consequence of basic social-distancing measures due to the public being aware of the epidemic outbreak and due to recommendations (such as washing hands often, not touching one's face, avoiding handshakes and keeping distance) and early measures (such as closing schools) by the Italian government, we set α = 0.422, β = δ = 0.0057 and γ = 0.285, so the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.66. Also, after day 12, we set ε = 0.143 as a consequence of the policy limiting screening to symptomatic individuals only; thus, totally asymptomatic individuals are almost no longer detected, while individuals with very mild symptoms are still detected (hence ε is not set exactly to zero). Due to this, R0 = 1.80. After day 22, the lockdown, at first incomplete, yields α = 0.360, β = δ = 0.005 and γ = 0.200; also, ζ = η = 0.034, μ = 0.008, ν = 0.015, λ = 0.08 and ρ = κ = ξ = σ = 0.017.

After day 38, a wider testing campaign is launched: this yields ε = 0.200, and also ρ = κ = ξ = 0.020, while σ = 0.010 and ζ = η = 0.025. Therefore, R0 = 0.85.

Thus, an important challenge in tuning the model is that the initial data are affected by statistical distortion: in particular, the values of the ratio death/infected are highly overestimated. The model fitting process must take this problem into account. Therefore, we decided to fit the parameters based on the data about the diagnosed infected population and the number of recovered diagnosed patients, but not on the data about deaths. It is also worth stressing that, in the long run, the model is weakly sensitive to the initial conditions; for this reason, the initial mismatch concerning the mortality data has little impact. We adopt a best-fit approach to find the parameters that locally minimize the sum of the squares of the errors. The model involves many state variables, as well as a large number of uncertain parameters whose numerical determination is a very challenging problem; it is likely that an infinite number of different parameter sets could be found, matching the data equally well. On the other hand, our parameters are control tuning knobs whose values should realistically reproduce the data and the reproduction number R0 in plausible scenarios. Relying on a priori epidemiological and clinical information about the relative parameter magnitude (as discussed above), and starting from a random initial guess, the model parameters have been fitted by reiterated local minimization of the sum of the squares of the errors. During the course of the simulation, the parameters have been updated based on the successive measures, of increasing strength, adopted by policymakers. In particular, the fraction of the population in each stage at day 1 is set as: I = 200/60e6, D = 20/60e6, A = 1/60e6, R = 2/60e6, T = 0, H = 0, E = 0; S = 1 – I – D – A – R – T – H – E.

After day 4, as a consequence of basic social-distancing measures due to the public being aware of the epidemic outbreak and due to recommendations (such as washing hands often, not touching one's face, avoiding handshakes and keeping distance) and early measures (such as closing schools) by the Italian government, we set α = 0.422, β = δ = 0.0057 and γ = 0.285, so the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.66. Also, after day 12, we set ε = 0.143 as a consequence of the policy limiting screening to symptomatic individuals only; thus, totally asymptomatic individuals are almost no longer detected, while individuals with very mild symptoms are still detected (hence ε is not set exactly to zero). Due to this, R0 = 1.80. After day 22, the lockdown, at first incomplete, yields α = 0.360, β = δ = 0.005 and γ = 0.200; also, ζ = η = 0.034, μ = 0.008, ν = 0.015, λ = 0.08 and ρ = κ = ξ = σ = 0.017. Hence, the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.60. After day 28, the lockdown is fully operational and gets stricter (working is no longer a good reason for going out: gradually, non-indispensable activities are stopped): we get α = 0.210 and γ = 0.110, hence R0 = 0.99. After day 38, a wider testing campaign is launched: this yields ε = 0.200, and also ρ = κ = ξ = 0.020, while σ = 0.010 and ζ = η = 0.025. Therefore, R0 = 0.85. The parameters above were used to simulate the model and generate the graphs reported in Fig. 2.

After day 4, as a consequence of basic social-distancing measures due to the public being aware of the epidemic outbreak and due to recommendations (such as washing hands often, not touching one's face, avoiding handshakes and keeping distance) and early measures (such as closing schools) by the Italian government, we set α = 0.422, β = δ = 0.0057 and γ = 0.285, so the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.66. Also, after day 12, we set ε = 0.143 as a consequence of the policy limiting screening to symptomatic individuals only; thus, totally asymptomatic individuals are almost no longer detected, while individuals with very mild symptoms are still detected (hence ε is not set exactly to zero). Due to this, R0 = 1.80. After day 22, the lockdown, at first incomplete, yields α = 0.360, β = δ = 0.005 and γ = 0.200; also, ζ = η = 0.034, μ = 0.008, ν = 0.015, λ = 0.08 and ρ = κ = ξ = σ = 0.017.

Due to this, R0 = 1.80. After day 22, the lockdown, at first incomplete, yields α = 0.360, β = δ = 0.005 and γ = 0.200; also, ζ = η = 0.034, μ = 0.008, ",

After day 38, a wider testing campaign is launched: this yields ε = 0.200, and also ρ = κ = ξ = 0.020, while σ = 0.010 and ζ = η = 0.025. Therefore, R0 = 0.85. The parameters above were used to simulate the model and generate the graphs reported in Fig. 2. The comparison between the official data and the curves resulting from the SIDARTHE model are provided in Extended Data Fig. 3. The current number of infected (including all stages), the number of recovered and the cumulative number of diagnosed cases are well reproduced, but a small mismatch can be noted in the last days when distinguishing between different SOI. This discrepancy can have two interpretations: on the one hand, the model considers infected with different severities (for example, ",
    "post_context": ") while the data report the actual treatment that the patients received (for example, the number of patients actually admitted to ICUs, which is constrained by the number of available beds and can be limited if the infected suddenly and quickly worsen, leading to death, before admission to the hospital). Hence, our overestimation of ICU patients may be due to saturation of the healthcare system, which is neglected in the model, or to the sudden worsening of infected who die at home before having the time to reach the ICU. Another possible explanation for our overestimation of patients with symptoms, and life-threatening symptoms, and our underestimation of patients LettersNATuRE MEDICINE"

In Fig. 3c,d, α = 0.105, hence R0 = 0.50 (significantly decreased). In Fig. 4a,b, ε = 0.400, hence R0 = 0.59 (decreased, although not as much as in the previous scenario). In Fig. 4c,d, α = 0.420 but also ε = 0.600, therefore R0 = 0.77 (reduced, although not as much as in the previous two scenarios). Conversely, Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the epidemic evolution that would have been predicted by the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy if, after  day 22, social-distancing countermeasures had been absent (Extended Data  Fig. 1a,b), mild (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), strong (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f) and very strong (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). In all cases, the actual CFR is ~7.2%, while the perceived CFR is ~9.0%. Extended Data Fig. 1a,b shows that, in the absence of further countermeasures after day 22 (just closing schools and hygiene recommendations), we have α = 0.422, γ = 0.285 and β = δ = 0.0057, hence R0 = 1.66 and the model predicts an evolution that leads to 73% of the population having contracted the virus (and ~64% having been diagnosed) and ~5.2% of the population having died because of the contagion over a 300-day horizon (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The peak of the number of concurrently infected individuals occurs at around 76 days and amounts to ~44% of the population; however, the peak of concurrently diagnosed infected individuals occurs later, around 82 days, and amounts to 39% of the population. Extended Data Fig. 1b shows how the different subpopulations of infected individuals evolve over time, and it is interesting to notice that each subpopulation reaches its peak at a different time. In particular, the fraction of infected who need intensive care reaches its peak, almost 16.5% of the population, after 107 days.

Over a 500-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1c, the model predicts an evolution that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected individuals around day 170, amounting to 11.7% of the population (10.6% of the population have been diagnosed). Eventually, 35% of the population have contracted the virus (and ~30% have been diagnosed) and ~2.5% of the population have died because of the contagion. The fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1d, reaches its peak on day 198, amounting to 5.3% of the population. The adopted social-distancing policy, although mild, has some impact and helps gain more time to strengthen and supply the healthcare system, but is still insufficient. Extended Data Fig. 1e,f shows that, with stronger social-distancing countermeasures, able to yield α = 0.200 and γ = 0.086, hence R0 = 0.787, now lower than 1, the peak is not delayed, but anticipated, because the increase in the number of new infected is reduced so much that it soon becomes a decrease. Over a 300-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e, the model predicts an evolution of the situation that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected individuals around day 50, amounting to 0.092% of the population; the peak in diagnosed infected occurs at day 54 and amounts to 0.083% of the population.

To illustrate the effect of changing the parameter values in the model, our sensitivity analysis results are reported in Extended Data Figs. 4–10.

The fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1h,  reaches its peak on day 64, amounting to 0.02% of the population. These scenarios, although surpassed, are fundamental to prove that lockdown was an appropriate policy, given that, in the absence of social-distancing countermeasures, the epidemic could have had tragic outcomes; also, they suggest—for countries early on in the outbreak evolution—that strictly enforcing the lockdown as early as possible leads to enormous benefits with respect to a delayed intervention. Model sensitivity analysis. We now investigate the sensitivity of the model to parameter variations, focusing in particular on the parameters that can be influenced by policymakers: transmission parameters, related to lockdown measures (α, β, γ and δ), and testing parameters, related to testing and contact tracing policies (ε, θ). To illustrate the effect of changing the parameter values in the model, our sensitivity analysis results are reported in Extended Data Figs. 4–10. Interestingly, the model is particularly sensitive to variations in the value of α and of ε. Increasing α significantly increases all the curves (Extended Data Fig. 4).  Also increasing the other t",

All these parameters can be decreased by policymakers, by enforcing lockdown and social-distancing measures, and stringent safety procedures in hospitals and for home assistance of diagnosed infected. Conversely, increasing ε significantly decreases all the curves (Extended Data Fig. 8). Also increasing the other testing parameter θ decreases all the curves—that is, decreases the values of all the variables, point by point, over time (Extended Data Fig. 9), but the sensitivity is smaller. These two parameters can be increased by policymakers by enforcing population-wide testing and contact tracing, focused on discovering, respectively, asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Discovering infected people at an earlier stage appears to help reduce the  contagion more. The other parameters are harder to control with prevention and mitigation strategies (Extended Data Fig. 10). Increasing ζ and η decreases the final number of infected and recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number of symptomatic and life-threatening infections initially increases, to decrease afterwards.

Increasing λ, as well as the other healing parameters ρ, κ, ξ and σ, decreases all the curves, apart from the curve of recovered patients, which initially increases (due to a higher recovery rate) and then eventually decreases (due to fewer infections overall).
