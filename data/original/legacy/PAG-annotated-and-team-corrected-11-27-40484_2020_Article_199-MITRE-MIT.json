COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures.

Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a ",

The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. Conclusions: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.

We developed a SUQC model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19. SUQC is applied to the daily released data of China to predict the trend of epidemic. SUQC can also provide quantitative guidance for other countries in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020 11 "

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines.

After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. Conclusions: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei.

Secondly, the epidemic trend heavily depends on multiple artificial factors, including local medical resources, quarantine measures, and the efficiency of confirmation approaches, which should be explicitly modeled. For example, the outbreak is more severe in Wuhan compared to other cities in China that constrains the medical resources, therefore the infected need a longer time to be confirmed and reported in the official released numbers. This potentially leads to a larger difference between real and reported infected cases in Wuhan than in other places. This could also explain why a sudden increase of confirmed infected cases was observed when clinical diagnosis was adopted in confirmation in ",

This is critical for controlling the spread across China. The characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak and control are distinct from existing infectious diseases, and the existing epidemic models cannot be applied to describe the observed data directly.

The novel coronavirus is believed to be infectious during incubation period when no symptoms are shown on the patients [4], an important characteristics differentiating COVID-19 from its close relative SARS. Considerable measures have been implemented to control the outbreak in Wuhan and China, mainly by quarantine to reduce transmission. On Jan 23, 2020, Wuhan restricted travel outside the city. Any person exposed to COVID-19 is required to perform a selfisolation for 14 days. Around Jan 25, 2020, nucleic acid kit was developed to diagnose the patients. On Feb 12, 2020, clinical diagnosis was used to assist the confirmation of infection in Hubei province. Nonetheless, COVID- 19 has spread to all provinces of China and more than 30 other countries in the last two months [5,6]. COVID-19 has three features that make it hard to describe with the existing epidemic models including SIR, SEIR etc. [7,8].

The total number of infected individuals is 62,577 (Table 1). We can do a similar analysis using stage I data of Wuhan. The stage I data is informative for predicting the epidemic trend assuming no rigorous quarantine and control measures. The first 10 daily data points (from Jan 20) were used to infer the parameters. The rest data points were used to test the performance of the model (Fig. 1C, D). As clearly seen in Fig. 1C, the predicted numbers of CðtÞ and IðtÞ increase dramatically, which are far beyond the observed numbers after Jan 21. The number of total infected can be as large as 8,923,823, and the epidemic lasts for a much longer time (328 days, see Table 1). The dramatic difference between predictions from stage I and Shilei Zhao and Hua Chen stage II data indicates the preventing measures and quarantines, such as travel restrict, are very efficient in controlling the outburst of the epidemic. Since more strict quarantine and traffic control measures were executed recently to inhibit the infection of COVID-19 in Wuhan and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 12, we also analyzed the stage III data (from Feb 13). The estimated quarantine rate is 0.6185, much higher than that of 0.3917 estimated based on stage II data. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to be 49,510, indicating a further acceleration of the epidemic end (Table 1). Similar analysis was accomplished on stage I and II data of Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), the whole country (excluding Hubei), and four tier-1 cities in China (Figs. 2 and 3; Supplementary Figs. S1–S4; Tables 1 and 2). Overall, the model predictions are in high accuracy.

The estimated quarantine rate is 0.6185, much higher than that of 0.3917 estimated based on stage II data. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to be 49,510, indicating a further acceleration of the epidemic end (Table 1). Similar analysis was accomplished on stage I and II data of Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), the whole country (excluding Hubei), and four tier-1 cities in China (Figs. 2 and 3; Supplementary Figs. S1–S4; Tables 1 and 2). Overall, the model predictions are in high accuracy. We see similar trends in these regions: the predicted numbers of infected are distinct between results from the two stage data, indicating the necessity and efficiency of quarantine and control measures. We note that even with stage I data, Beijing has a reproductive number smaller than 1 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 2, 0.8840), indicating an early-stage prompt and effective response to COVID-19.

And only the un-quanrantined can infect the susceptible individuals; While in SEIR, all the infected are infectious; (2) the quarantine rate is a parameter in SUQC to explicitly model the effects of quarantine and control measures; (3) SUQC distinguishes the confirmed infected individuals (observed data) and the total infected individuals, and the parameter confirmation rate is affected by medical resources and the sensitivity of diagnosis methods.

S is the same as that in existing infectious disease models, e.g., SIR and SEIR. U =U ðtÞ, the number of infected and un-quarantined individuals that can be either presymptomatic or symptomatic. Different from E in the SEIR model, U are infectious, and can render a susceptible to be unquarantined infected. Q=QðtÞ, the number of quarantined infected individuals. The un-quarantined infected become quarantined infected by isolation or hospitalization, and lose the ability of infecting the susceptible. C=CðtÞ, the number of confirmed infected cases. The number of confirmed infections is released by the official agency or media, which may be the only variable with observation that we can access.

METHODS SUQC model SUQC takes into account the following novel epidemic features of COVID-19: (1) the epidemic has an infection probability during the incubation (presymptomatic) period; (2) various isolation measures are used to control the development of the epidemic; (3) the main data source is the daily number of confirmed infections released in the official report, which is affected by the detection method and has a delay between the real infected and confirmed infected number. Four variables related to the features are used to model the flows of people between four possible states: S=SðtÞ, the number of susceptible individuals with no resistance to disease in the population. S is the same as that in existing infectious disease models, e.g., SIR and SEIR. U =U ðtÞ, the number of infected and un-quarantined individuals that can be either presymptomatic or symptomatic. Different from E in the SEIR model, U are infectious, and can render a susceptible to be unquarantined infected. Q=QðtÞ, the number of quarantined infected individuals. The un-quarantined infected become quarantined infected by isolation or hospitalization, and lose the ability of infecting the susceptible. C=CðtÞ, the number of confirmed infected cases. The number of confirmed infections is released by the official agency or media, which may be the only variable with observation that we can access. Note that C is usually smaller than the number of real infected individuals, due to the limited sensitivity of diagnosis methods. The duration of incubation can also cause a time delay of confirmation. Nevertheless, C is also the number useful for monitoring and predicting the trend of epidemic dynamics.

Confirmed infected numbers during this time interval may be less biased and represent natural character of COVID-19, while confirmed numbers are small and fluctuating at early stages before Jan 20 and are affected by strict quarantine measures in later stages. The parameter α is hard to estimate accurately. The values estimated by using different methods or different data sets range from 0.3 to 0.5 [9–11]. Luckily in SUQC an accurate value of α is not necessary; the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=α=g1 as a compound parameter is sensitive in parameter optimization, and thus the bias of α can be balanced by g1. Other free parameters and initial values, including g1, β, U ð0Þ and Qð0Þ, are estimated by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model. Denote ^C=f ðg1,β,U0,Q0Þ as the expected daily time series of confirmed infections provided by the model (Eq. 2), which was solved by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with given values of g1, β, U ð0Þ and Qð0Þ. Define the loss function, errðα,g1,U0,Q0 Þ=jjC – ^Cjj 2 (3) The loss function is then optimized with the interiorpoint method implemented in the MATLAB function fmincon to infer the parameter values.

The parameter α is hard to estimate accurately. The values estimated by using different methods or different data sets range from 0.3 to 0.5 [9–11]. Luckily in SUQC an accurate value of α is not necessary; the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=α=g1 as a compound parameter is sensitive in parameter optimization, and thus the bias of α can be balanced by g1. Other free parameters and initial values, including g1, β, U ð0Þ and Qð0Þ, are estimated by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model. Denote ^C=f ðg1,β,U0,Q0Þ as the expected daily time series of confirmed infections provided by the model (Eq. 2), which was solved by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with given values of g1, β, U ð0Þ and Qð0Þ.

We try different initial values in parameter optimization, and notice that the inferred parameter values are not sensitive to the provided initial values.
