Mitigation and  suppression  of  new  infections  have  emerged  as  the  two predominant public health control strategies5.

Serological testing is essential to identifying individuals who have been infected, recovered and are immune (in the near term) to SARS-CoV-2. Several scenarios have been explored that show substantive decreases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to baseline given enhanced interactions with recovered individuals that reduce the risk of transmission. As with all modeling studies, our predictions come with reasonable assumptions; nonetheless, controlling the course of the epidemic could benefit from identifying seropositive individuals and integrating their behavior into multifaceted intervention approaches.

We use our core shielding model as the basis for application to COVID-19, as it represents the conservative  benefits  of  shielding;  however,  detailed  mixing  and  substitution models could also lead to further variations of this model, such as in spatially explicit domains or on networks21–24. Here, we apply our model of shield immunity to the epidemiological  dynamics  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  For  simplicity,  we ignore births and other causes of death. We consider a population of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious asymptomatically (Ia), infectious  symptomatically  (Is)  and  recovered  R  who  are  free  to  move without  restrictions  in  a  'business  as  usual'  scenario.  A  subset  of symptomatic cases will require hospital care, which we further divide into  subacute  (Ihsub)  and  critical  and/or  acute  (requiring  intensive care unit (ICU) intervention, Ihcri) cases. We assume that a substantial  fraction  of  critical  cases  will  die.  Age-stratified  risk  of  hospitalization and acute cases are adapted from the values from ref.  5,  which models potential outcomes in the United Kingdom and the United States. The full model incorporating shield immunity (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2) differs from conventional SIR models with social distancing or case isolation interventions. The rate of transmission is reduced by a factor of 1/(Ntot + αRshields) where Ntot denotes the fraction of the population in the circulating baseline, and ",

Shielding can augment social distancing, particularly when social distancing is largely ineffective (Fig. 4).

    "post_context": " is equivalent to a nearly 50% reduction in transmission in the absence of shield immunity. However, there is a compromise. Because social distancing reduces contacts and transmission, there are fewer recovered  individuals  when  β  is  reduced  by  50%.  Nonetheless  benefits of shielding accrue at all levels of social distancing. Social distancing  and  shield  immunity  could  work  in  combination  to  improve outcomes in terms of expected hospitalization burden, suggesting a role for shield immunity in reducing transmission and reducing the negative impacts of suppression-level social distancing policies. Finally,  targeted  shield  immunity  could  also  enhance  population outcomes by focusing the effort of recovered individuals in subsets of the population. Heuristic solutions to an optimization formulation  of  targeted  (age-specific)  shield  immunity  in  this  model  are shown in Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10. By preferentially targeting older individuals by shielding those at highest risk, it is possible to further reduce cumulative deaths by ~30%. Population-wide serological testing is urgently needed. We have shown a rationale for serological testing as a means to facilitate interventions complementary to mitigation and suppression. Identifying and  deploying  recovered  individuals  represents  an  opportunity  to slow transmission by developing population-level shield immunity. 852 NAtuRe MeDICINe | VOL 26 | JUNE 2020 | 849–854 | www.nature.com/naturemedicine LettersNATurE MEDICINE                              "
