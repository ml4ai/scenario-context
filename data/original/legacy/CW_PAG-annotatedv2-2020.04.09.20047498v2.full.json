For example, South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts, and many European countries are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or a region. Specifically, there is a need to , i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an identify destructive policies ​ alternative and should not be implemented.  We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Methods. Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population over time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care.

The time span covers up to two years starting from Feb 18, 2020, with one day intervals. The model uses the population and age structure of the Helsinki University Hospital District (HUS) in ",
    "post_context": ". It follows a population over time at individual level during different stages of the disease. It estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care, including remaining treatment capacity. It also estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available at each time point.  This model is based on random interactions between agents, and the interactions lead to outcomes with fixed probability distributions (see Table 1). The states are similar to those in SEIR models (e.g. Wilson et al., 2020), which are typically described by differential equations. Although the individual events and times spent in different states are probabilistic, many key parameters whose real-world values still involve significant uncertainty are assumed as known constants in a simulation. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were done with two key parameters: the fraction of asymptomatic infections and the probability of infection given exposure to the virus. In addition, the five ready-made simulations at the web interface were run for 100 times with different random seeds to investigate their sensitivity to random in-model variation. There is a clear user interface where any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. mobility restriction, several levels of testing and tracing, and inserting cases into the area. A publicly available instance of the model is online at https://korona.kausal.tech/sim is open-source and the  code is available at release that produced the results of this article is 1.0.

Black arrows: transitions between the states. Red arrows: infection pathways. Green boxes: targeted (isolation) and broad (mobility restriction) population subgroups under varying degrees of social isolation. Incubating state contains people that already have the virus and may spread it but the actual illness (i.e., symptoms) has not yet started (see Table 1). In this model, the \"exposed\" state is treated implicitly, and the \"infectious\" state is divided into four sub-states. Thus, they are not shown here as state names. The healthcare system has the following properties: number of hospital beds, number of hospital beds available, number of intensive care beds, number of intensive care beds available, testing mode (lazy: test only people with severe symptoms; active: test also people with mild symptoms; aggressive: test also people with mild symptoms and contacts of coronavirus positive people), number of coronavirus tests run per day, length of testing queue. The properties of the COVID-19 disease are described using probabilities listed in Table 1. An important part of the model is the contact algorithm. Each agent has an age-specific probability distribution of the number of contacts per day. Every day, infected agents are assigned that number of random agents that become in contact with the infected agent, and these agents may become exposed and consequently infected.  ",
    "post_context": ". The model keeps track of every contact the infected agents have. This enables the examination of different testing and tracing policies. The current model version can test all agents with symptoms and then perform contact tracing with a given accuracy, which can be adjusted by the user. Tuomisto et al.

The scenarios used lazy and aggressive testing policies, respectively, and both scenarios adjusted the mobility restrictions to achieve an acceptable outcome.  The two scenarios predict clearly different outcomes. The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 ",
    "post_context": ") and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs 1050). In addition, three other scenarios were calculated. One looked at permanent implementation of the current strict mobility restrictions (50%) and predicted a suppression of the epidemic before the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also shown in Figure 4). Two other scenarios looked at mild restrictions from the start (25%) or relaxation of restrictions before summer (to 30%); both predicted a rapidly increasing epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). Figure 2 (next page). A screenshot from the model output. Timeline of a mitigation strategy (new hospital beds, 30-40% mobility restriction and only severe cases tested). At the end of the one-year simulation, there are 660000 recovered patients (data not shown). The results are for a single simulation run, not an average of an ensemble. Figure 3 (two pages forward). A screenshot from the model output. Timeline of a suppression strategy (initially 50% and later 20-25% mobility reduction with aggressive testing of mild cases and tracing of contacts).

The two scenarios were created to either slow down the spread of the epidemic or to suppress the number of cases. The scenarios used lazy and aggressive testing policies, respectively, and both scenarios adjusted the mobility restrictions to achieve an acceptable outcome.  The two scenarios predict clearly different outcomes. The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs 1050). In addition, three other scenarios were calculated. One looked at permanent implementation of the current strict mobility restrictions (50%) and predicted a suppression of the epidemic before the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also shown in Figure 4). Two other scenarios looked at mild restrictions from the start (25%) or relaxation of restrictions before summer (to 30%); both predicted a rapidly increasing epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively).

The decision makers may ignore the health and economic benefits of suppression if they believe that testing and tracing is technically or logistically impossible or ethically unbearable due to, e.g., privacy issues. Suppression can be seen as problematic because it is required until a vaccine or cure is available, and there is no guarantee of Tuomisto et al.

Another possible goal in the future is integration to different data sources. In order to test and use this model in different geographical areas, the local demographic and mobility (contact) data and parameters need to be imported to the model. Possible sources for this include data from Google mobility solutions, for example. Ideally, we could approach modeling where the input data for the model is updated in real time. Fourth, the REINA model could be integrated with other models, which are able to calculate social and economic consequences of the disease as well as those of the mobility restrictions. New indicators need to be deployed, e.g. the years of life lost. In this way, the decision makers in the future would be able to balance medical, social and economic consequences in a rational yet humane way. The model is published online for anyone to test and analyse. Also the code is openly available with an open license. The objective is to help anyone critically evaluate the details and find possible mistakes and shortcomings. Also, those who find the model useful may freely copy it for their own purposes and develop it further.
