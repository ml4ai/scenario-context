This approach has the advantage of being relatively simple, grouping in few mathematical parameters the many conditions which affect the spreading of the disease. On the other hand, it requires previous data from the disease transmission in the country, being better suited for regions where the epidemic is not at a very early stage.

Studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a rapidly human-to-human and asymptomatic transmission, mainly by respiratory droplets, which makes it more contagious than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), other well-known coronaviruses diseases, despite the contamination similarity.

A data-driven model to describe and forecast the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission identified virus is closely related to SARS-CoV (79%) and MERS-CoV (50%) [1],[4]. Concerning the clinical aspects of COVID-19, the most common symptom reported was fever, followed by cough. A severe onset of the disease can lead to death due to alveolar damage and respiratory failure [1],[3],[5],[6]. Under these circumstances, COVID-19 has been spread through over 100 countries and all of the continents in a couple of months after its first confirmed case and it was declared, by the World Health Organization (WHO), a public health emergency of international matter in ",
    "post_context": " [1],[7]. As of April 11th, 2020, about 1.6 million cases and 100.000 deaths were confirmed globally, showing an expressing breakthrough in Europe (839257 confirmed and 70565 deaths) and the region of the Americas (536664 confirmed and 19294 deaths) in comparison to the outbreak area (118549 confirmed and 4017 deaths). The most affected countries are the United States of America, Italy, Spain, China, Germany and France [8]. In the past two decades, there have been two coronavirus epidemics that also led to global health consternation, SARS in 2003 and MERS around 2012. It is noteworthy that COVID-19 has already killed more people than both of those diseases combined [9],[10]. Other epidemics have also ravaged the world and been considered an international emergency: H1N1 (2009), poliomyelitis (2014), Ebola (2014, 2019) and Zika (2016) [1]. Meanwhile, scientists have always had an essential role to play in the study of the dynamics of infectious diseases, particularly in mathematical modeling. The study of epidemiological mathematical models leads to deep understanding of the dynamics of epidemics, being an important tool to assess the potential effects of preventive and controlled measures, especially when their characteristics are still unclear [11],[12]. Recent works about COVID-19 models present different approaches to describe the proportions of its transmission and future numbers. The most common ones are the SusceptibleInfectious-Recovered/Death (SIRD) model [1],[13] and the Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRecovered (SEIR) model [14–16]; both derived from the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) pioneer model described by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [14–17].

Under these circumstances, COVID-19 has been spread through over 100 countries and all of the continents in a couple of months after its first confirmed case and it was declared, by the World Health Organization (WHO), a public health emergency of international matter in January 2020 [1],[7]. As of April 11th, 2020, about 1.6 million cases and 100.000 deaths were confirmed globally, showing an expressing breakthrough in Europe (839257 confirmed and 70565 deaths) and the region of the Americas (536664 confirmed and 19294 deaths) in comparison to the outbreak area (118549 confirmed and 4017 deaths). The most affected countries are the United States of America, Italy, Spain, China, Germany and France [8]. In the past two decades, there have been two coronavirus epidemics that also led to global health consternation, SARS in 2003 and MERS around 2012. It is noteworthy that COVID-19 has already killed more people than both of those diseases combined [9],[10]. Other epidemics have also ravaged the world and been considered an international emergency: H1N1 (2009), poliomyelitis (2014), Ebola (2014, 2019) and Zika (2016) [1]. Meanwhile, scientists have always had an essential role to play in the study of the dynamics of infectious diseases, particularly in mathematical modeling. The study of epidemiological mathematical models leads to deep understanding of the dynamics of epidemics, being an important tool to assess the potential effects of preventive and controlled measures, especially when their characteristics are still unclear [11],[12]. Recent works about COVID-19 models present different approaches to describe the proportions of its transmission and future numbers. The most common ones are the SusceptibleInfectious-Recovered/Death (SIRD) model [1],[13] and the Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRecovered (SEIR) model [14–16]; both derived from the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) pioneer model described by Kermack and McKendrick in ",

Provided that, for each country two phases are assumed: (i) when no measures are taken such as reduction of social interaction and (ii) when public policies act to reduce the spread of the disease. Only the parameters linked to the transmissibility rates are allowed to change between these two phases. Moreover, the basic reproduction number is deduced for the proposed model and calculated from the parameters in the two phases.

It has been demonstrated that if R0 > 1, then the disease-free equilibrium point is unstable, i.e., an infected individual is enough to remove the system from the neighborhood of the DFE and infection of the population is possible. On the other hand, R0 < 1 entails local asymptotic stability. The authors argue in [23] that the definition of R0 in terms of the model is not purely dependent on the model equations only.

This optimization problem is solved using a Sequential Quadratic Program algorithm [24], adopting as starting point the parameters used in [21] to describe the MERS epidemic. 2.4 Data source The COVID-19 data used in this paper, with the number of infected and deceased people in each country, were downloaded from the website of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [25] on June 19th, 2020. 3 Results The resulting parameters from the estimation are shown in Table 3, where the numbers in subscript \"1\" and \"2\" indicate whether the parameter refers to the first or second period, respectively. The basic reproduction number was also calculated for both periods and is depicted separately in Table 3, since it is not a model parameter. The data of number of cumulative infected individuals and deceased per day as well as the model output for these variables are shown in Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, for China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the ",

In these cases, the black continuous lines represent the predictions with the nominal parameters from Table 3 and the dashed lines are variations when selected parameters are changed by ±30%. 4 Discussion In Figs 2 to 7, it can be seen that there is a good match between the model output and the observed data. Furthermore, the model presents accurate forecasts of the disease progression. There are some variations between the nominal prediction and the observed data, but within the established tolerances. The uncertainty in the prediction increases as more time has passed since the date when the model was calibrated; these uncertainties are reduced if the model parameters are updated periodically. Although an overall good match was obtained for China (Fig 2), a mismatch can be seen on the four days before 12-feb. This difference is ascribed to the fact that the country changed the notification methodology on 12-feb [26], reporting more than 15000 cases on a single day, which caused a discontinuity in the cumulative cases on this date.

Its parameters were estimated with a numerical optimization algorithm, based on data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. An analysis was presented for the six countries where the pandemic is widely spread: China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the USA. A good match between theoretical and observed data was achieved and a forecast was presented. Since the model is data-driven, one drawback is that it cannot be used for countries where the epidemic is at a very early stage. Nevertheless, in the lack of local data, the pandemic behavior can still be estimated using parameters from another country. However, in this case, the uncertainty in the estimations would be higher. It should be pointed out that forecasting the future is always imprecise, and that predictions are better for the near future. The outcome of the epidemic might be significantly altered by changes in governmental policy, such as enforcing or releasing measures to reduce social contact, or by other factors such as overload of the health care systems.
