    "post_context": " compared to other countries (May 5, 2020 [5]). It is possible to notice that Brazil is surpassing countries like Italy, South Korea, Japan, and China, reaching the relative number of cases in the United Kingdom and France. As of the date of this study, the United States is the epicenter of the pandemic. reality was quite different. Scientific and medical knowledge was much more limited, making it difficult to fight the disease. Furthermore, the world was not globalized, the means of transport were not as agile as the current ones, and the population was much smaller. The 21st century is marked by globalization and an intricate and intense social network connecting in one way or another to everyone on the planet. The latter fact increases the danger that a local epidemic disease will rapidly evolve into a pandemic like what happened in Wuhan, China, and now is all over the world. The form of propagation and contagion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is through direct contact between individuals, via secretions, saliva, and especially droplets expelled during breathing, speech, coughing, or sneezing. The virus also spreads by indirect contact, when such secretions reach surfaces, food, and objects [1]. Besides, infected people take a few days to manifest symptoms, which can be severe or as mild as a simple cold. There is even a large proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic [2]. Therefore, it is hard to quickly identify the infected and apply effective measures to limit the disease's spread. Also, the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 is very recent in the face of the current epidemic. Little is known about the COVID-19 disease, which appears to be highly lethal, with no drugs to prevent or treat. The concern is more significant since direct (individual–individual) and indirect (individual–objects–individual) social relations are the means of spreading the disease. Thus, the social interaction structure is the key to create strategies and guide health organizations and governments to take appropriate a"

Edges represents the relationships between two elements and its value can also represent the strength or weight of a connection if e(vi, vj) > 0. For a G with only e(vi, vj) = {0, 1| ∀i,j 0 < i, j ≤ n} the model is an unweighted graph. Furthermore, a network is undirected if e(vi, vj) = e(vj, vi) and directed, otherwise. Usually, applications with complex networks consist of two main steps: (i) transform the real structure into a complex network, and (ii) analyze the model and extract its features or understand its dynamics. A society is a natural phenomenon that has a straight forward connection to a complex network. People are connected due to several aspects: family members, religious groups, co-workers, members of the same school, or faculty, among other social relationships. Therefore, CNs have been widely employed for social network analysis [13]. Small world networks [14] can be used as a good approximation of the social connections. In 2000, Moore [14] emphasized that the use of small-world networks, where the distance among two elements is usually small compared to the size of the population, showed a faster spread of the viral disease than classical diffusion methods. The approximation of real social phenomena was first explained by Milgram [15] in [15]. The sociologist is the author of the well-known idea that there are always chains of up to six people connecting any two individuals globally, which reinforces the importance of analyzing the pandemic spread from a graph view. In the context of epidemic propagation analysis, one of the best known and widely used models is the susceptible– infected–recovered (SIR) model, which is composed of three categories of individuals [16,17] • Susceptible: the ones who are not infected but could change their status to infected if in contact with a sick person combined with ",

Also, the model can be described as ds dt = −βis N , di dt = βis N − γ i, dr dt = γ i (1) where s, i and r represents the ratio of susceptible, infected and recovered people in the population, respectively and N represents their absolute sum. Usually, the SIR model is solved with differential equations. However, considering a social network, it is possible to analyze the disease spreading through agent-based techniques. The study of coevolution spreading dynamics is an active field in network science [18]. Combining the SIR model with networks can represent the nature of the spread of viral diseases in a more complex scenario. Therefore, consider a fully connected network, meaning that e(vi, vj) = {1, ∀i,j 0 < i, j ≤ N} Eq. (1) then fits the structure perfectly. However, in the real world, not everyone is connected, and people only contract the disease if in contact with an infected individual or object. This is why a complex network approximates the dynamics of real viruses and can help us to understand the disease behavior better. In [19], the authors used smallworld networks to simulate a SIR model. However, they considered that every contact with an infected person resulted in contamination, which is not realistic. Therefore, other researchers improved the model over the years, adding new constraints to approximate the simulation to real scenarios [20]. The SIR model on networks works as follows: each node represents a person, the elements are connected according to some criteria, and the epidemic propagation happens through an agent-based approach. It starts from a random node, and for each time-step nodes with the susceptible state can contract the disease from a linked infected node wi"

Therefore the probability of a family having ten persons is the sum of the larger sizes, the details of this distribution are given in Table 1. The first layer is then created following the family size distribution and ensuring that each family has at least one adult. Fig. 2(a) shows the structure of such a layer built for a population of n = 100. A large fraction of the population in any country need to work or practice some kind of economic activity, which means interacting with other people. Thus, work represents one of the most important factors of social relations, which is also very important in an epidemic scenario. To represent the work activity, we propose a generic layer to connect people with ages from 18 to 59 years, i.e., 60% of the total population in the case of Brazil. There is a wide variety of jobs and companies, therefore it is not trivial to create a connection rule that precisely reflects the real world. Here, we consider a common scenario with random groups of sizes around [5, 30], uniformly distributed, and internally connected (such as the ''home'' layer). An example of this layer is shown on Fig. 2(b), using n = 100. Although the nodes of a group are fully connected, the transmission of the virus depends directly on the edge weights, which we discuss in-depth on Section 3.1.1. Collective transports are essential in most cities but are among the most crowded environments and play an important role in an epidemic scenario due to the possibility of geographical spread, as vehicles are constantly moving around. The third layer we propose represents these public transports that include people who do not possess or use a personal vehicle. In Brazil the number of people using public transport depends on the size of the city, with 64.98% in the capitals and 35.89% in other cities [23], with an average use of around 1.2 h a day.1 Here we consid"

There is a wide variety of jobs and companies, therefore it is not trivial to create a connection rule that precisely reflects the real world. Here, we consider a common scenario with random groups of sizes around [5, 30], uniformly distributed, and internally connected (such as the ''home'' layer). An example of this layer is shown on Fig. 2(b), using n = 100. Although the nodes of a group are fully connected, the transmission of the virus depends directly on the edge weights, which we discuss in-depth on Section 3.1.1. Collective transports are essential in most cities but are among the most crowded environments and play an important role in an epidemic scenario due to the possibility of geographical spread, as vehicles are constantly moving around. The third layer we propose represents these public transports that include people who do not possess or use a personal vehicle. In Brazil the number of people using public transport depends on the size of the city, with 64.98% in the capitals and 35.89% in other cities [23], with an average use of around 1.2 h a day.1 Here we consider the average of the population between the two cases (50%), randomly sampled, to participate in the ''transports'' layer.

Fig. 3 illustrates all the infected states and mechanisms described here. This configuration results in an overall lethality of 4%. It is important to stress that we consider a maximum of 25 days of infection time, which is the time frame based on most studies we have seen in the literature. We are still at the beginning of the pandemic, and a better characterization of the long-term impact is challenging. Nonetheless, the available information allows us to represent the most noticeable features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to evaluate its main effects on society. To simulate the reduction or increase of social distancing/quarantine, we remove/include some layers of the network, or change their edge weights. Similarly to the approach on [26] to improve home contact when in quarantine, we increase the home layer edge weights by 20% for each removed layer. To counterbalance that, we considered a smaller number of hours of contact in the base calculation for the home layer (3 h a day), considering that this layer has a full connection between people of the same family. When the home contacts are increased according to our approach of layer removal, the time/intensity of contacts may increase up to its double. 4.

This factor was empirically found by approximating the model results in the number of reported cases in Brazil. It is important to stress that for better statistics, it should be considered the largest possible number of nodes to represent a population, i.e., the ideal case would be n = total country/city population.

Comparison to real data We compare the model's output in the first 83 days with real data available from the Brazilian epidemic (up to May 18) [5,40–42], results are shown on Fig. 4(b). Using β = 0.3 causes a better fit for the real data, and this is a rather fair infection rate considering the actual scenario where most people wear masks and take increased precautions to avoid being infected. The model achieves a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation. The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed.

Future actions and its impacts After the initial epidemic phase, we consider four possible actions that can be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) Do nothing more, maintaining the current isolation levels; b) Stop isolation, returning activities to normal (initial network layers and weights); c) Return only work activities, restoring the initial probability of the layer; or d) Increase isolation, stopping the remaining activities in work and transports layers (home and random remains). Firstly, we analyze the impacts on the number of daily new cases and deaths; results are shown in Fig. 6. As previously mentioned, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil performed fewer tests by order of magnitude than other countries with similar epidemic numbers. Therefore we considered as diagnosed only the severe and critical cases, which are pronounced subjects for testing, and 20% of the mild cases. The total infection ratio is discussed later. Considering keeping the current isolation levels, the peak of daily new cases occurs around 100 days after the first case (June 5), with around 11,000 confirmed cases.

The peak of daily new deaths occurs around 118 days (June 23), with an average of 1900 deaths, and goes below 100 new occurrences after around 210 days (September 24). It is important to stress that this is a hypothetical scenario where the isolation level remains the same from day 27 to 300, which is hardly true in the real world where it is constantly changing [43].

Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported on this paper (see the ''keep isolation'' scenario in the next section). Concerning the daily death toll, the average number of the proposed models is higher than that of the official numbers. This is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the first officially confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating that the real death toll may be significantly higher than the official numbers. 4.2. Future actions and its impacts After the initial epidemic phase, we consider four possible actions that can be taken after 90 days (May 26): a) Do nothing more, maintaining the current isolation levels; b) Stop isolation, returning activities to normal (initial network layers and weights); c) Return only work activities, restoring the initial probability of the layer; or d) Increase isolation, stopping the remaining activities in work and transports layers (home and random remains). Firstly, we analyze the impacts on the number of daily new cases and deaths; results are shown in Fig. 6. As previously mentioned, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil performed fewer tests by order of magnitude than other countries with similar epidemic numbers. Therefore we considered as diagnosed only the severe and critical cases, which are pronounced subjects for testing, and 20% of the mild cases. The total infection ratio is discussed later. Considering keeping the current isolation levels, the peak of daily new cases occurs around 100 days after the first case (",
    "post_context": "), with around 11,000 confirmed cases. After 202 days (September 15), the average daily cases is around 500, and it goes below 100 daily cases after around 237 days (October 19). The peak of daily new deaths occurs around 118 days (June 23), with an average of 1900 deaths, and goes below 100 new occurrences after around 210 days (September 24). It is important to stress that this is a hypothetical scenario where the isolation level remains the same from day 27 to 300, which is hardly true in the real world where it is constantly changing [43]. The total numbers after the last day (300) account for 946,830 (±10, 507) diagnosed cases and 149,438 (±3, 124) deaths. When we consider the return of all activities after 90 days, the number of cases and deaths grows exponentially. The peak occurs at 108 days (June 13) with an average of 40,937 (± 11,010) new cases, and at 122 days (June 27) with an average of 6,484 (± 1,739) new deaths. Although the peak of cases/deaths and the decrease of the numbers occur early, in this case, the final result is critically worse, with a total of 1,340,367 (± 18,513) diagnosed cases and 212,105 (± 4,359) deaths. It is important to notice that we considered that all the activities return after 90 days and remain fully operational until the last day (300). Moreover, we do not account for the overloading of hospitals, which directly impacts the final death count. Therefore, the number of deaths may be considerably higher. Another possible scenario is the return of the work layer only, keeping reduced transports and no schools and no religious activities. However, the pattern is similar to 9 "

The dotted lines represent the standard deviation, and in the case of the real data, the curve is the average over a 5-day window, and the solid lines the real raw data. The highest average number of deaths produced by the proposed model may be related to underdetection (See Fig. 5). Fig. 5. To understand the impact of the COVID-19 underdetection in Brazil, we considered the official death records of 2019 and 2020 at the same period (January 1 to April 30) [44]. Then the total death difference is compared to the COVID-19 records of the WHO [42] and the Brazilian government [44] data. The largest difference that appears right after the first confirmed case may indicate a significant underdetection of COVID-19 cases. returning all activities, considering the growth time, peak, and decay time. The final numbers in this case are 1,253,119 (± 26,009) diagnosed cases and 197,756 (± 5,693) deaths. If the isolation is strictly increased after 90 days (lockdown), the infection and death counts drop significantly compared to the other approaches. Moreover, the recovering time is much faster, as daily new cases stop earlier than the different scenarios. The peak of daily new cases happens around day 93 (June 1) and daily new deaths around day 106 (June 11). The total number of diagnosed cases and deaths after day 300 are 552,855 (± 195,802) and 87,059 (± 30,871). Considering the hospitalization time described in the scheme of Fig. 3, it is possible to estimate the number of occupied beds for regular hospitalization (severe cases) and ICU/Ventilation (critical cases). We also show the difference between the cumulative growth of diagnosed and undiagnosed cases and recovered cases. The same approach as the previous 10 "

However, the occupancy of 66,110 (± 16,759) regular beds and 33,470 (± 7,926) ICU beds is still critical for the Brazilian health system. The situation may remain under control during the peak of hospitalization occupancy by considering the creation of new provisional ICU units and excellent patient logistics. However, the results show that hospital occupancy is prolonged considerably in this scenario. They may stay functioning around their maximum capacity for up to a month (with an average of occupied ICU beds above 30,000). When increasing the isolation, the peak of occupied beds is smaller, with an average of 63,226 (± 20,682) regular beds and 31,816 (± 10,592) ICU beds. Moreover, the curve's shape throughout the days is different, and the final numbers are considerably smaller. The peak also occurs around a week earlier and then decreases much faster. This scenario would be preferable as it has many more chances of not overloading the Brazilian healthcare system, relieving the hospital occupancy considerably quicker, and reducing the number of deaths. 5. Conclusion This work presents a new approach to modeling the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics based on multi-layer complex networks. Each node represents a person, and edges are social interactions divided into six layers: home, work, transports, schools, religions, and random relations. Each layer has its characteristics based on how people usually interact in that activity. The propagation is performed using an agent-based technique, a modification of the SIR model, where weights represent the infection probability that vari"

The overall pattern of results is similar to the previously observed for the number of diagnosed cases and deaths. It is possible to notice that the number of undiagnosed cases is much higher than the diagnosed cases. This reflects the number of asymptomatic cases and the lack of tests for mild cases. In the worst scenario, which means ending the isolation, the total infected number may go above 5 million. The recovered rate is directly proportional to the infected rate, as one needs to be infected to either die or become resistant to the disease. If the infected rate is high, so is the recovered rate, e.g., the scenarios of keeping or ending isolation. A high recovered rate also helps in mitigating the epidemic propagation (natural immunization). However, increasing isolation decreases the spread much faster than natural immunization, with a considerably smaller death toll. It is also possible to observe the differences at the start of effective recovering, i.e., when the recovered rate surpasses the infected rates, this is due to the early increase in isolation levels. The peak of hospitalization occupancy occurs around a week before the death peaks, in any scenario. In this case, ICUs are very important because critical patients are treated there, representing the cases of higher death rates. Within the ''end isolation'' setting, patients may occupy up to 215,285 (± 48,682) regular beds and 109,520 (± 24,647) ICU beds. These numbers are greater than entire Brazil's capacity, as publicly available and private ICU beds sum up to 45,848 [45]. Even considering the better scenario, i.e., the lower bound of the standard deviation, the number of occupied ICU beds may reach around 86,000, critical for ",

When the isolation levels are kept, the numbers are significantly lower. However, the occupancy of 66,110 (± 16,759) regular beds and 33,470 (± 7,926) ICU beds is still critical for the Brazilian health system. The situation may remain under control during the peak of hospitalization occupancy by considering the creation of new provisional ICU units and excellent patient logistics.

Moreover, the curve's shape throughout the days is different, and the final numbers are considerably smaller. The peak also occurs around a week earlier and then decreases much faster.

We then considered that only hospitalization cases and 20% of the mild cases are diagnosed. Asymptomatic cases are not diagnosed and keep acting normally in the network, considering the active layers. Regarding the isolation of infected nodes, we take some optimistic assumptions: Mild cases (even those not diagnosed) are aware of its symptoms and isolate themselves at home.
