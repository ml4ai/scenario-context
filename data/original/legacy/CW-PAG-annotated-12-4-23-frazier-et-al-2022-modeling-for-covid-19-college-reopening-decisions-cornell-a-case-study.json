Colleges and universities across the globe faced this question in summer 2020 as they considered whether to offer in-person instruction. They continue to face this question today as they contemplate partially vaccinated student populations, waning immunity, booster shots, and the potential for new variants to emerge. These questions are significant because outbreaks in university student populations have occurred regularly (1) and may harm the health of students and more-vulnerable employees and community members that interact with them (2). Even when vaccination protects the bulk of the population against the most severe health outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, widespread breakthrough infections would threaten the health of unvaccinated and immunocompromised individuals in their midst. At the same time, social distancing, masking, asymptomatic screening, the migration of in-person instruction to a virtual format, vaccine mandates, and other interventions that can be brought to bear against university outbreaks all incur social and financial costs (3, 4). Better understanding the protection offered by these interventions would support providing safety while minimizing these costs. These questions remain difficult to answer because vaccination levels, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and other conditions continue to change and because experiences at the city, state, and national level do not easily generalize to university populations. Indeed, university populations are younger than the general population and thus have increased rates of contact (5) that may elevate virus transmission (2, 6). In addition, universities can implement interventions that would be substantially more difficult for the general population, such as mandatory vaccination and mandatory asymptomatic screening (7, 8). Universities have responded to this central question in dramatically different ways. In the ",
    "post_context": ", many schools went fully online, while many others opened for in-person instruction with a modest set of interventions centered around symptomatic testing, contact tracing, and social distancing (9). Moreover, those schools that opened for in-person instruction pursued dramatically different testing strategies (10). Some tested only symptomatic students, others tested all students once on arrival, and others tested all students at least once per week. In the fall 2021 semester, schools differ in whether they mandate vaccines, their testing strategies, and masking policies (11). This diversity in approach reflects, in part, a diversity of circumstance, such as proximity to, and interaction with, population centers, prevalence in those population centers, availability of housing to quarantine students, and the desires of the surrounding community (12). However, it also reflects substantial continued uncertainty about how policy translates into outcomes. Such uncertainty and diversity in approach among universities reflects the larger response to the pandemic, in Significance Decisions surrounding how to safely reopen universities directly impact 7% of the US population (students, staff) and indirectly impact tens of millions more (families, communities). After witnessing large COVID-19 outbreaks among students from August 2020 to the present, universities want to provide safety while minimizing social and financial costs, despite uncertainty about vaccine hesitancy, vaccine efficacy, more transmissible variants with the potential for immune escape, and community prevalence. When the Delta variant is dominant, we find substantial risk reduction in moving student populations from mostly (75%) to fully (100%) vaccinated, in testing vaccinated students once per week even when all students are vaccinated, and in more frequent testing targeted to the most social groups of students.

However, it also reflects substantial continued uncertainty about how policy translates into outcomes. Such uncertainty and diversity in approach among universities reflects the larger response to the pandemic, in Significance Decisions surrounding how to safely reopen universities directly impact 7% of the US population (students, staff) and indirectly impact tens of millions more (families, communities). After witnessing large COVID-19 outbreaks among students from August 2020 to the present, universities want to provide safety while minimizing social and financial costs, despite uncertainty about vaccine hesitancy, vaccine efficacy, more transmissible variants with the potential for immune escape, and community prevalence. When the Delta variant is dominant, we find substantial risk reduction in moving student populations from mostly (75%) to fully (100%) vaccinated, in testing vaccinated students once per week even when all students are vaccinated, and in more frequent testing targeted to the most social groups of students.

Our modeling approach hinges on delineating those simulation model input parameters yielding epidemics that can be successfully controlled versus those that cannot. If the set of plausible input parameters are contained within the set of safe parameters, then we can be highly confident, although never certain, that the epidemic can be controlled. At Cornell in summer 2020, we demonstrated this to the university administration for a suite of interventions available with in-person instruction: frequent asymptomatic screening, testing students on arrival to campus, contact tracing, social distancing on campus, limits on student and employee travel, masking requirements, and a behavioral compact curtailing student social gatherings. It was also possible that we would have found that plausible ranges of the input parameters overlapped the portion of parameter space where epidemics would grow out of control, in which case we would not have been able to recommend reopening. We found that access to regular asymptomatic screening (7, 23), with an ability to increase testing frequency if needed, was critical. Indeed, those few universities employing a similar asymptomatic screening approach succeeded, by and large, in controlling campus outbreaks (24â€“27).

We find that a small group of students has significantly more intergroup viral transmission than other groups and plays an important role in determining the risk of an outbreak. We find that targeting interventions to this group provides substantial protection against outbreaks. Unlike students, we find that employees have very little transmission at work and are well separated from students, with extremely little transmission across the two groups. This has implications for understanding the risk to older and more vulnerable individuals from student infections. When considering a range of interventions against the Delta variant, we find that achieving high levels of vaccination provides significant protection, but that, even in a 100% vaccinated student population, there is significant potential for breakthrough outbreaks in the absence of asymptomatic screening and social distancing.

This resulted in the decision to reopen Cornell's Ithaca campus with a fully residential semester in fall 2020 (20). including university subpopulations' We additionally measure key parameters of a university population needed for understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread, intergroup and intragroup rates of viral transmission and how it has changed over time with vaccination, the Delta variant, and relaxation in social distancing. We find that a small group of students has significantly more intergroup viral transmission than other groups and plays an important role in determining the risk of an outbreak. We find that targeting interventions to this group provides substantial protection against outbreaks. Unlike students, we find that employees have very little transmission at work and are well separated from students, with extremely little transmission across the two groups. This has implications for understanding the risk to older and more vulnerable individuals from student infections. When considering a range of interventions against the Delta variant, we find that achieving high levels of vaccination provides significant protection, but that, even in a 100% vaccinated student population, there is significant potential for breakthrough outbreaks in the absence of asymptomatic screening and social distancing. This is consistent with findings from other modeling studies (19). While once per week asymptomatic screening of vaccinated students might be sufficient in many situations, we find that testing vaccinated student groups with high rates of social contact twice per week substantially reduces risk even when the entire population is vaccinated. We also find that moving from 75% vaccination to full vaccination provides substantial additional protection.

We then used observed data to estimate other key model parameters: one governing the effectiveness of contact tracing for students and employees, the rate of transmission between the three student groups up to a proportionality constant, and the rate of infection from outside sources for students and employees. After, one free parameter remained for employees (transmission rate) and one for students (a proportionality constant giving the transmission rate between each student group). We estimated these parameters, separately for employees and for students, by calibrating simulation results to observed data, varying each parameter to minimize the sum of squared differences between the mean of the model's predictions and the observed cumulative infection count (SI Appendix, section 2).

Over the spring 2021 semester, students affiliated with Greek-life organizations and varsity athletes were tested more frequently at three times per week. In late March 2021, a cluster of cases among students in the Masters in Business Administration (MBA) program led to elevating their test frequency to twice per week for the duration of the semester. As indicated in the figure, a color-coded campus alert level was used to warn students of elevated risk during four periods in this timeframe. The average calibrated trajectory closely tracks observed cases for both fall 2020 and spring 2021. There is some deviation during both semesters when a single high-transmission individual or event led to a burst in the number of cases not captured by our model. Nevertheless, observed trajectories are contained within the 10th to 90th percentiles on nearly all days, indicated by the shaded regions in Fig. 1 B and C. Fig. 1D summarizes key calibrated parameter values. Groups of students participating in Greek-life social organizations and varsity athletics are found to have a significantly higher rate of transmission than others. We find later that screening these groups more often significantly reduces risk. For most groups, estimated transmission in spring 2021 is higher than in fall 2020, consistent with colder weather and fatigue with social distancing restrictions driving more indoor gatherings and the Alpha variant becoming more prevalent in the United States. In spring 2021, the testing frequency for students in Greek life and varsity athletes was raised. This likely led to the reduction in the number of cases found per contact trace, as a contact trace was more likely to be initiated before a student had infected others. Lastly, the vast majority of cases spread within the same group. More detailed information on the spread between groups can be found in SI Appendix, section 2.

We fit a linear model to quantify the first-order impact of each parameter on infections. We then multiply the estimated rate at which residential infections change as we vary a parameter (from this linear model) by the width of the range quantifying uncertainty for this parameter (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Table S22).

This family of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model. Within this family, we name two for more frequent use, given in Fig. 1F: the nominal and pessimistic scenarios, corresponding to pessimism levels 0.5 and 0.99, respectively. We indicate the latter in plots as \"pessimistic (residential)\" to distinguish it from a scenario that is pessimistic about a different outcome defined in Results D. (The nominal scenario also corresponds to setting each parameter to the middle of its range, that is, to the mean of the prior.) Relative to the nominal scenario, the pessimistic scenario significantly increases the asymptomatic ratio and transmission rate while decreasing test sensitivity and contact tracing effectiveness. These parameters also have the largest absolute normalized effect on infections (Fig. 2A). This is visualized in SI Appendix, Fig. S15. To understand the impact of the assumption of linearity used when creating these scenarios, we compared the median number of infections under q pessimistic scenarios against the q quantile of median infections, drawing parameters from the prior (SI Appendix, section 3.B), for varying q. We found strong agreement (SI Appendix, Fig. S16), suggesting that the linearity assumption had little impact on the level of pessimism inherent in our scenarios.

Additional testing can mitigate this risk (Fig. 2D). When the test frequency is high enough, predicted infections remain low even at pessimism levels as high as 0.99. Plots of infections versus test frequency and simulation parameters were distributed in public reports (42) and at Cornell Faculty Senate meetings (43).

In addition to testing, which was instituted at the start of the semester, a second measure combating parameter uncertainty is recourse: the opportunity to change interventions based on data as it is observed, ranging from, for example, enforcement of behavioral policies or modified social distancing policies targeted to certain areas of the campus to a broad decision to shut the campus down. Indeed, a reopening decision that was likely to be safe but not guaranteed to be so under a fixed set of interventions (testing frequency) can be made more safe by the ability to bring additional interventions to bear if needed. Modeling decision makers' ability to shut down the campus upon observing substantial transmission, Fig. 2 E and F shows outcomes under plans of the form \"initiate campus shutdown if confirmed cases exceed more than Y cases in X weeks\" as a function of the pessimism level. While simpler than the more nuanced decision-making process available to leaders in practice, these plans take a simple interpretable form to support broad understanding and are reminiscent of cumulative sum control charts used for monitoring industrial processes for defects (44). They essentially \"learn\" whether reality is such that infection control is not being provided, and then respond by shutting down when a threshold is reached. Varying X and Y trades acting quickly against \"false alarms\" in which the campus would be shut down when infection control would have been achieved had it stayed open. Fig. 2 E and F demonstrates that adding recourse through shutting down can reduce the risk of reopening.

We first generated ranges for these additional parameters based on information available in June 2020 (SI Appendix, section 3.A), extending our prior probability distribution to include independent normal priors for these new parameters. We also extended our nominal scenario for residential instruction to set each of these additional parameters to the center of its range. In this extended model, reduced population density lowers transmission for unmonitored off-campus students relative to off-campus students during residential instruction, but lower compliance with social distancing and masks raises transmission. These effects can offset each other, or one can be more dominant, depending on parameters. Reduced use of now-optional testing blunts its benefits. Fig. 3A shows that reduced use of testing by the off-campus population can lead to a substantial number of infections, while outcomes are less sensitive to the number of offcampus students. To understand the relative safety of residential and virtual instruction under plausible parameter configurations, we sampled 200 parameter configurations from the prior. Fig. 3B then plots the number of infections under residential and virtual instruction for each of these configurations.

Exploring further, we extended each of the 2,000 parameter configurations used for our residential infection sensitivity analysis (Results C) to include the four additional virtual instruction parameters (SI Appendix, section 3.E) and used simulation to predict virtual instruction infections (in the on-campus students and employees and the off-campus virtual instruction students in Ithaca) under each parameter configuration, enabling a comparison with predicted residential instruction infections for each configuration. We then identified a new collection of parameter configurations of varying pessimism about the relative safety of residential instruction compared to virtual instruction. To do so, we adopted the same approach used to identify configurations of varying pessimism about residential infections but taking our primary outcome as the difference in infections between residential instruction and virtual instruction (a positive value indicates (SI Appendix, section 3.A). residential has more infections) We refer to this difference as residential-virtual infections. The nominal scenario remains the same and corresponds to pessimism level 0.5. We obtain a new pessimistic scenario, corresponding to pessimism level 0.99. Unlike the pessimistic scenario for residential infections, this new pessimistic scenario (SI Appendix, Table S22 and Fig S15) decreases R0 relative to nominal. This is because the most likely parameter configurations with large residential - virtual infections (according to the fitted linear model) are those in which transmission is small regardless of instruction method.

This was the case at Cornell, where a significant number of students had signed leases with local landlords for fall 2020 before the severity of the pandemic became clear, and a survey revealed that many students were planning to return to Ithaca even if residential instruction and on-campus housing were not offered (20, 34). For universities like Cornell, located in college towns, where the student population is significant relative to the overall population, this influx of students may represent a significant increase in the number of young people in the area. This could be dangerous because these young people may be socially cohesive, and, during normal times, young people have elevated rates of social contact (5, 45). Moreover, a university may have reduced ability to mandate and enforce behavioral restrictions and asymptomatic screening for students taking classes virtually even if they are nearby. Thus, when deciding whether to reopen, in addition to whether the number of infections can be kept reliably low during a residential semester, an additional key consideration is the risk of an outbreak among virtual instruction students. In other words, a key trade-off is whether to invite back all students and have stronger behavioral and screening interventions, or to have a smaller number of students return but have weaker interventions. To study this trade-off, we extended our model to capture virtual instruction at Cornell's Ithaca campus. Under virtual instruction, staff and faculty, along with some research-focused graduate students, stay on campus. They are tested 2Ã—/wk and are subject to the same behavioral compact governing student behavior under residential instruction. We also model some other students returning to ",

We assume that Cornell offers twice-weekly testing to these students, but noncompliance is higher than in a residential semester. This extended model included four additional parameters, about which we also had uncertainty (SI Appendix, Table S21). We thus extended our parameter uncertainty framework to understand the range of outcomes possible under virtual instruction. We first generated ranges for these additional parameters based on information available in June 2020 (SI Appendix, section 3.A), extending our prior probability distribution to include independent normal priors for these new parameters. We also extended our nominal scenario for residential instruction to set each of these additional parameters to the center of its range. In this extended model, reduced population density lowers transmission for unmonitored off-campus students relative to off-campus students during residential instruction, but lower compliance with social distancing and masks raises transmission. These effects can offset each other, or one can be more dominant, depending on parameters. Reduced use of now-optional testing blunts its benefits. Fig. 3A shows that reduced use of testing by the off-campus population can lead to a substantial number of infections, while outcomes are less sensitive to the number of offcampus students. To understand the relative safety of residential and virtual instruction under plausible parameter configurations, we sampled 200 parameter configurations from the prior. Fig. 3B then plots the number of infections under residential and virtual instruction for each of these configurations.

We picture these results in Fig. 5. First, we evaluate whether the calibrated model is consistent with the range of likely scenarios identified in Results C. A comparison of calibrated parameters (SI Appendix, Table S25) shows that the calibrated parameters are consistent with our prior. Fig. 5A compares observed infections to a range of scenarios. Observed infections were close to the nominal scenario and well under the pessimistic scenario for almost the entire semester, consistent with their design. While the observed values are quite close to the nominal scenario's predictions, this was accidental. Indeed, it was clear, a priori, that model outputs are sensitive to inputs, and these inputs were unknown, so the predictive accuracy of the range across scenarios, in the sense of whether it contained reality or not, is more important than whether a point prediction was close to the realized trajectory.

The figure also shows that there would have been limited benefit in increasing the total testing capacity. Turning to the question of whether to reopen campus, Fig. 5C shows the expected Cornell infections for a virtual fall semester under our calibrated model, varying the number of returning undergraduate students and their test compliance. More than 80% of the returning students would need to remain test compliant throughout the entire semester to achieve a number of infections comparable to reopening campus (where fewer than 250 occurred). As discussed previously, enforcement of test compliance would have been significantly more challenging in a virtual scenario, and, therefore, the decision to reopen campus was robust. While the benefit of hindsight would have modestly improved testing efficiency, the decision we selected gave health outcomes similar to the best policies possible with hindsight. Analysis for Fall 2021.

Similar to the primary question of virtual vs. in-person education, the epidemiological modeling demonstrated the imperative of continued surveillance testing for the Cornell community residing in Ithaca beyond Thanksgiving. Fourth, the model indicated the need to increase the frequency of surveillance testing for the most socially active students from 2Ã— per wk to 3Ã— per wk at the beginning of the spring 2021 semester. Fifth, the model was the basis for the summer 2021 decision to screen vaccinated students. Sixth, as cases grew quickly at the start of the fall 2021 semester, the model was used to make the case for prioritizing additional contact tracing staffing to reduce test delays and to elevate testing frequency for students in Greek-life organizations. Upon implementing the interventions, daily cases fell dramatically. Finally, the modeling effort also played an important role in enhancing communication with the communityâ€”as a tool for explaining the considerations in making decisions, and for explaining what might happen and why. Use at Other Universities. Considering other universities, we find that testing students, on average, once per week, even in the presence of high vaccination rates, is important in limiting infections when the Delta variant is dominant. Further testing beyond that level can help, but, for maximum benefit, it is sufficient to target this testing to the most social students. This finding is consistent with student outbreaks observed in cohorts with high vaccination rates that were being tested once per week at Duke and Harvard Universities (52, 53). When applying results contingent on vaccination level, keep in mind that our analysis assumes unvaccinated individuals have immune systems naive to SARS-CoV-2. Infection-acquired immunity shares at least some characteristics with vaccination, in that (future) infection probability and severity if infected is lowered (54). Moreover, many universities had large outbreaks in the ",
    "post_context": ", and the most social students on campus would have been among the most likely to be infected. Thus, in applying our results, a university's level of immunity may be higher than what its vaccination level would suggest. Our finding that there is little or no interaction leading to transmission between Cornell university employees and students is important for understanding and mitigating risks to employees at other universities. At Cornell, we have found that the biggest risk to employees is through their interactions outside the university. Our finding that a small group of highly social students plays a large role in viral transmission in the Cornell student population may be important for designing interventions at other universities. If a comparable group can be identified at other universities and specific interventions brought to bear that prevent spread within this group, then this may provide outsized protection for the resources required. In applying our results to other universities in the future, it is important to keep in mind several specific characteristics of the Cornell population and environment that lent themselves to the strategies developed. 1) Beginning early in the pandemic, Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine had substantial capacity to provide PCR testing, exploiting pooling. 2) Ithaca has had lower prevalence than much of the rest of the country and is several hours' drive from major cities. 3) Cornell's student population is largely residential, with few commuting from nearby communities. 4) Cornell's students have been largely willing to comply with social distancing, masking, and testing policies. 5) Cornell has access to a hotel on campus and other buildings that have been used for quarantine and isolation capacity. Beyond universities, our modeling framework can be applied to other closed (or nearly closed) communities such as cruise ships, prisons, retirement homes, homeless shelters (55), military bases, or professional sports bubbles.

Sampling parameters from the posterior, we then simulated potential trajectories for infections over the fall semester. This enabled a comparison of the effectiveness of different testing frequencies under different vaccination levels, as might be seen at universities similar to Cornell; Fig. 6B shows results for 50%, 75%, and 100% vaccination. We see that a nonuniform testing policy that focuses on highly social students is highly effective, but that, if vaccination levels are not sufficiently high, then substantial infections can result irrespective of testing policy. SI Appendix, Fig. S21B includes additional results that show that, for 50% and 75% vaccination levels, testing students once per week brings the great majority of the benefits of testing that are possible, and, at 100% (and lower levels), there is still important benefit in some testing, even of vaccinated students. In contemplating projected infections for vaccinated populations, including Cornell's fall 2021 semester, it is important to keep in mind that vaccination substantially reduces the possibility that an individual COVID-positive patient will become seriously ill. Indeed, considering a vaccine whose estimated efficacy is 95% in preventing serious illness given infection (see, e.g., ref. 51), one needs 1/(1 âˆ’ 0.95) = 20 cases in vaccinated individuals to create the same expected number of cases with serious illness as one case in an unvaccinated individual. Thus, the gap in health outcomes between different vaccination levels is larger than the gap in infections seen in Fig. 6B. Moreover, in Cornell's overwhelmingly vaccinated population (96% as of October 9, 2021), the chance of a serious negative health outcome during the fall 2021 semester is likely lower than in the fall 2020 semester despite a higher projected number of cases.

This finding is consistent with student outbreaks observed in cohorts with high vaccination rates that were being tested once per week at Duke and Harvard Universities (52, 53). When applying results contingent on vaccination level, keep in mind that our analysis assumes unvaccinated individuals have immune systems naive to SARS-CoV-2. Infection-acquired immunity shares at least some characteristics with vaccination, in that (future) infection probability and severity if infected is lowered (54). Moreover, many universities had large outbreaks in the 2020â€“2021 school year, and the most social students on campus would have been among the most likely to be infected. Thus, in applying our results, a university's level of immunity may be higher than what its vaccination level would suggest. Our finding that there is little or no interaction leading to transmission between Cornell university employees and students is important for understanding and mitigating risks to employees at other universities. At Cornell, we have found that the biggest risk to employees is through their interactions outside the university. Our finding that a small group of highly social students plays a large role in viral transmission in the Cornell student population may be important for designing interventions at other universities. If a comparable group can be identified at other universities and specific interventions brought to bear that prevent spread within this group, then this may provide outsized protection for the resources required.

Further, within a single compartment, we assume that infectiousness does not vary across individuals or over time, in contrast to, for example, ref. 7. Moreover, we model the impact of age and its effect on the distribution of infection severity in a discretized way. We do not model overdispersion in contacts (for example, one individual having many more contacts than another), because our estimated transmission parameters are based on empirical R0 estimates often driven by the most social individuals. When infections are driven by spread among subpopulations with the highest transmission, empirical estimates of R0 naturally correspond to transmission rates in these subpopulations. Methods Here we provide an overview; SI Appendix gives full details. Simulation Model: Overview. We model COVID-19 transmission using a compartmental model with Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered compartments along with additional compartments to reflect specific characteristics of COVID-19 and the interventions applied (Fig. 1A). To account for asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, the infectious phase is split into three compartments: Infectious, Asymptomatic, and Symptomatic. Individuals formerly in the Exposed compartment enter the Infectious compartment before randomly being assigned to either the Asymptomatic or Symptomatic compartments. We also add compartments for quarantined noninfected individuals (Quarantine) and isolated infected individuals (Isolation). Due to signific"

Transmission is modeled as stochastic, and the number of new infections in each group has a Poisson distribution with a mean determined by the product of the contact matrix and the transmission probability and the number of nonisolated infectious individuals in each group. Simulation Model: Quarantine and Isolation. We model three mechanisms for identifying and quarantining/isolating infected individuals. 1) Testing is the first mechanism. Every day, a fraction of each group is selected uniformly at random to be tested, and test results are available the same day. The number of individuals selected to be tested per group per day is determined by the group's testing frequency. (This is a conservative approximation to what had been implemented, where each student is tested at a specified frequency.) 2) Symptomatic self-reporting is the second mechanism. Every day, each symptomatic individual not in Isolation has a constant probability of self-reporting their symptoms, upon which they enter Isolation the same day. 3) Contact tracing is the final mechanism. Each case found through testing or self-reporting is contact traced. (Cases found through contact tracing are not, themselves, modeled as contact traced. This is an approximation of reality that is necessary because our simulation tracks counts within groups, not individuals.) Each contact trace moves a Poisson-distributed number of people to Quarantine or Isolation after a 1-d delay. We assume that contact tracing only finds contacts within the same group as the source case, reflecting the social dynamics of college campuses. Parameter Configurations of Varying Pessimism.

We then graph the outcome under this configuration versus P (âˆªy (cid:2)â‰¤y A(y (cid:3))), that is, the probability under the prior of seeing a parameter configuration whose outcomes (under the linear model) are no worse than those in A(y).
