Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-loadbased transmissibility.

Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-loadbased transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine.

Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America. a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Kerr CC, Stuart RM, Mistry D, Abeysuriya RG, Rosenfeld K, Hart GR, et al.

    "pre_context": "22]. In developing Covasim, our aim was to produce a tool that would be capable of informing real-world policy decisions for a variety of national and subnational settings. We wanted to capture the benefits of agent-based modeling (in particular, the ability of such models to simulate the kinds of microscale policies being used to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic), whilst making use of recent advances in software tools and computational methods to minimize the complexity and computation time typically associated with such models. In this regard, Covasim is most similar to the OpenABM-Covid19 model [23,24], which has also been developed as a high-performance, user-friendly, general-purpose COVID model. Overall, the design principle we followed with Covasim was to make common usage patterns as simple as possible, while still giving the user the ability to customize virtually all aspects of the simulation. For example, Covasim comes pre-loaded with demographic data for each country (Section 2.4), but users can also define custom populations and contact networks down to the level of a single city [25] or even university [26]. Common COVID-19 interventions are built into Covasim (Section 2.5), and custom interventions of arbitrary complexity can also be defined. In addition, Covasim's high performance for an agent-based model, achieved via dynamic rescaling (Section 2.6.2) and array-based computations (Section 2.7.1), means that most analyses can be run on a standard laptop, removing the need to use a highperformance computing cluster except for large parameter sweeps or model calibrations (Section 2.6.8). These design choices are intended to allow users to start running simple Covasim analyses quickly, while providing flexibility later if more detailed data become available or if the modeling questions become more nuanced.

Conceptually, the model is largely focused on a single type of calculation: the probability that a given agent on a given time step will change from one state to another, such as from susceptible to infected, or from critically ill to dead. Once these probabilities have been calculated, a pseudorandom number generator with a user-specified seed is used to determine whether the transition actually takes place for a given model run. The logical flow of a single Covasim run is as follows. First, the simulation object is created, then the parameters are loaded and validated for internal consistency, and any specified data files are loaded (described in Section 2.6.1).

However, Covasim also includes an \"edge-clipping\" intervention (considering a contact between two agents as a weighted \"edge\" between two \"nodes\"), where β remains unchanged but the number of contacts that person has is reduced. Complete school and workplace closures, for example, can be modeled either by setting β to 0, or by removing all edges in those contact layers; partial closures can be modeled by smaller reductions in either β or the number of contacts.

However, the distinction becomes important when considering the interaction between physical distancing and other interventions.

For example, it may be reasonable to assume that people can trace members of their household immediately and with 100% probability, while tracing work colleagues may take several days and may be incomplete. Digital contact tracing can be approximated in Covasim as a standard contact-tracing intervention with zero delays, with the caveat that tracing multiple steps (i.e., contacts of contacts) within a single day would require a custom intervention. 2.5.4 Isolation of positives and contact quarantine. Isolation (referring to behavior changes after a person is diagnosed with COVID-19) and quarantine (referring to behavior changes after a person is identified as a known contact of someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19) are the primary means by which testing interventions reduce transmission. In Covasim, people diagnosed with COVID-19 can be isolated. Their contacts who have been traced can be placed in quarantine with a specified level of compliance; people in quarantine may also have an increased probability of being tested. People in isolation or quarantine typically have a lower probability of infecting others (if infectious) or of acquiring COVID-19 (if quarantined and susceptible). The default reductions for isolation are 70% in the household and 90% in school, work, and community layers, while quarantine is assumed to have lower compliance (40% reduction in the household and 80% in other layers). However, if psychosocial support is not provided to people in home isolation or quarantine, there may be an increased risk of passing on infection to, or acquiring infection from, other household members. For performance reasons, isolation and quarantine are implemented as reductions in per-contact transmission risk rather than changes in the number of contacts; for realistic parameter values (i.e., ",

    "pre_context": "PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Covasim: An agent-based model of COVID-19 dynamics and interventions 2.6.2 Dynamic rescaling. One of the major challenges with agent-based models is simulating a sufficient number of agents to capture an epidemic at early, middle, and late stages, without requiring cumbersome levels of memory or processor usage. Whereas compartmental SEIR models require the same amount of computation time regardless of the population size being modeled, the performance of agent-based models typically scales linearly or supralinearly with population size (see Section 2.7.1). As a consequence, many agent-based models, including Covasim, include an optional \"scaling factor\", where a single agent in the model is assumed to represent multiple people in the real world. A ",
    "post_context": ", for example, corresponds to the assumption that the epidemic dynamics in a city of 2 million people can be considered as the sum of the epidemic dynamics of 10 identical subregions of 200,000 people each. However, the limitation of this approach is that it introduces a discretization of results: model outputs can only be produced in increments of the scaling factor, so relatively rare events, such as deaths, may not have sufficient granularity to reflect the epidemic behavior at a small scale. In addition, using too few agents in the model introduces stochastic variability patterns that do not reflect real-world processes in the entire population.

Once a certain threshold is reached, however (by default, 5% of the population is non-susceptible), the non-susceptible agents in the model are downsampled and a corresponding scaling factor is introduced (by default, a factor of 1.2 is used). For example, in a simulation of 100,000 agents representing a true population of 1 million with a threshold of 10% and a rescaling factor of 2, dynamic rescaling would be triggered when cumulative infections surpass 10,000, leaving 90,000 susceptible agents; dynamic rescaling would then resample the non-susceptible population to 5,000 (now representing 10,000 people) and increase the number of susceptible agents to 95,000 (now representing 190,000 people), i.e. with every agent now counting as two. If the epidemic expands further, this process will repeat iteratively until the scale factor reaches its upper limit (which in this example is 10, and which would be reached after 100,000 cumulative infections).

One of the major challenges with agent-based models is simulating a sufficient number of agents to capture an epidemic at early, middle, and late stages, without requiring cumbersome levels of memory or processor usage. Whereas compartmental SEIR models require the same amount of computation time regardless of the population size being modeled, the performance of agent-based models typically scales linearly or supralinearly with population size (see Section 2.7.1). As a consequence, many agent-based models, including Covasim, include an optional \"scaling factor\", where a single agent in the model is assumed to represent multiple people in the real world. A scaling factor of 10, for example, corresponds to the assumption that the epidemic dynamics in a city of 2 million people can be considered as the sum of the epidemic dynamics of 10 identical subregions of 200,000 people each. However, the limitation of this approach is that it introduces a discretization of results: model outputs can only be produced in increments of the scaling factor, so relatively rare events, such as deaths, may not have sufficient granularity to reflect the epidemic behavior at a small scale.

Unlike in a compartmental model, where Re can only be estimated by using simplifying assumptions, in an agent-based model, methods 2 and 3 can be implemented by simply counting exactly how many secondary infections are caused by each primary infection. By doing so, all details of the epidemic– including time-varying viral loads, population-level and localized immunity, interventions, network factors, and other effects–are automatically incorporated, and do not need to be considered separately. While methods 2 and 3 are implemented in Covasim, they have the disadvantage that they introduce significant temporal blurring, due to the potentially long infectious period (and, for method 3, the long recovery period). To avoid this limitation, the default method Covasim uses for computing Re is to divide the number of new infections on day t by the number of actively infectious people on day t, multiplied by the average duration of infectiousness (\"method 4\"). This definition of Re is nearly identical to the definition of the \"instantaneous reproductive number\" in Gostic et al. [73], which in that study is used as the ground truth against which other Re estimators are compared. Covasim also includes an estimate of the epidemic doubling time, computed similarly to the \"rule of 69.3\" [74], specifically: T à 2 wlog Ö Ü =niÖ t t Ü niÖ Ö where T is the doubling time, ",
