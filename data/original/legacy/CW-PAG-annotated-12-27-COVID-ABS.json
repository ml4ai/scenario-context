This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pan- demic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation.

Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was imple- mented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a mul- titude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongo- ing outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coro- navirus 2 (so-called SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] . The World Health Organi- zation  (WHO)  declared  the  outbreak  a  Public  Health  Emergency of International Concern on January 30th 2020, and a pandemic on March 11th. In Brazil, the first confirmed case was on Febru- ary 25th 2020, when a man from São Paulo tested positive for the virus. Since then, Brazil has been severely affected. As of June 26th 2020, the country reached more than 1,220,0 0 0 confirmed cases ∗ Corresponding author at: Grupo de Pesquisa em Ciência de Dados e Inteligência Computacional - { ci ∂ic }, Brazil. ",

In addition to the public health crisis, the coronavirus has im- pacted all aspects of life, politics, education, economy, social, envi- ronment and climate. It is also having an unprecedented impact on  global  supply  chains  and  production.  The  only  known  effec- tive course of action to fight the disease outbreak is to implement highly restrictive social distancing measures on the population, as reported  by  a  number  of  studies  and  systematic  reviews  [2–4] . Many countries are implementing such interventions with differ- ent degrees of success. Given the complexity of the societies, it is hard to predict the implications of such actions in the short and medium terms [5] . Therefore,  modeling  and  simulating  the  COVID-19  epidemic  is  a relevant  and  helpful  way  to  understand  the  spread  of  the  dis- ease and the epidemiological effects of social distancing interven- tions. For this purpose, many studies in the literature have devel- oped or adapted equation-based models to simulate the COVID-19 "

Some  authors  added  new  states  to  refine  the model, for instance, super-spreaders [32] or isolated [13,14,16,18– 20,23,24,26,27] , hospitalized [13,14,19,20,23,27] , and asymptomatic infected [18,20,21,23,28] . We note that equation-based models to simulate the epidemic represent  the  majority  among  those  proposed  in  the  literature.

Discussion The proposed model tries to apprehend the complexity of the social, epidemiological and economical relationships, but without being  simplistic.  Then,  the  complexity  of  the  model  reflects  the complexity of the system being modelled although on a smaller scale. Previous  versions  of  the  model  did  not  consider  social  con- straints and routines and, despite the good performance of the epi- demiological response variables, it could not accurately represent the economic dynamics. The introduction of social constructs, as families and businesses, and periodical routines, such as working hours, free time and bed time, brought more feasibility to the sim- ulation and improved the performance of the economic response variables when compared with the real world values. These  social  constructs  and  periodic  routines  are  hard-coded, although they can be adapted by users. Major flexibility is provided by the parameter set that can be adjusted to represent from a sin- gle community to a complete country. In the next section, the experimental methodology is discussed, as well as the performance metrics and their evaluation. 4. Experimental methodology To  evaluate  the  proposed  approach,  seven  different  scenarios that reflect adopted and/or hypothetical social distancing interven- tions  have  been  formulated.

It is meant to  isolate  the  economic  dynamic  and  can  be  used  to  assess  the impacts of the different interventions in the economy. For comparison among scenarios, the increase in wealth, (cid:10)W i S , for the group of agents, i ∈ { A 1, A 3, A 4}, in scenario S is computed as follows: W i (11) (cid:10)W i S = S,T − W i B,T W i B,T where ",

Baseline ( B ): no coronavirus pandemic This scenario simulates the economic behavior without a pan- demic. It is used as baseline for comparison with all the other sce- narios.

Scenario 5: partial isolation In the scenarios with lockdown (2 and 3), the mobility of all agents must be restricted, requiring restrictive public policies en- forced by the government. When these policies are non-existent or are not taken seriously by the entire population, partial isolation levels are reached. The partial isolation level IL ∈ [0, 1] means the percentage of the population that is fulfilling the isolation, while the remaining 1 − IL is not. Then, it is possible to define that in the lockdown IL ≥ 0.9, con- sidering that essential services and a few industries can not stop in order to avoid supply breakdown.

This scenario aims to assess the effects of intermediate IL s. It was simulated by randomly choosing agents A 1 with probability IL ← 0.5 to stay at home. Observing the results in Fig. 9 , although the I t curve is flattened when compared with scenarios B and 4, it is still less efficient than scenarios 2 and 3. Notice the D t  still grows exponentially before reaching the peak. For the economic perspective, this scenario be- haves similarly to the baseline. These metrics offer evidence that IL ← 0.5 is not enough for effective epidemiological control, and a level of isolation greater than that is recommended. The impact of different isolation levels can be seen in Figs. 10 and 11 , for IL ∈ [0.3, 0.9], which represents the response of epi- demiological and economical curves for increasing IL . In Fig. 10 it is possible to see how the infection curve I t flattens as the isolation level increases from no isolation towards lockdown. Fig. 11 shows that  as  the  value  of  IL  increases,  wealth  loss  of  the  A3  agents is higher, represented by W A 3 S,t  curve, showing the importance of agent's mobility in the economy. 5.7.

This scenario represents the pol- icy of mandatory usage of face masks and physical distancing, but without imposing restrictions on the mobility of agents.

Conclusion CRediT authorship contribution statement The  COVID-19  pandemic  brought  to  humankind  many  chal- lenges, including the demand for new medical treatments, social policies and economical approaches. The fast response of the scien- tific community to deal with coronavirus was divided into studies of the epidemiological aspects, proposals of new treatments and diagnostic tools and new models to forecast the viral spreading, in- cluding SIR and SEIR models among others.

With this viewpoint, although the epidemiologi- cal aspects are priority, the social and economical aspects can not be neglected. The present work proposed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that simulates the epidemiological and economical effects of COVID-19 pandemic in a closed society, whose results can be generalized for wider contexts and used by governmental rulers to prospect social policies and assess its potential effectiveness in real scenarios. The model was encapsulated in the free and open source soft- ware library COVID-ABS, which contains 29 epidemiological, social, demographic and economic input parameters, and 10 output re- sponse variables.

These  scenarios present  a  slower  evolution  of  the  epidemic,  a  smaller  number of infections and deaths. Given the impossibility of implementing lockdown policies, the scenario with 50% of social isolation with using masks and physical distancing was the best approach in the preservation of lives.
