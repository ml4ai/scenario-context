Here, we present three basic models of disease transmission that can be fit to data emerging from local and national governments. While the Imperial College study employed an agent-based method (one that simulates individuals getting sick and recovering through contacts with other individuals in the population), we present three macroscopic models: 1) exponential growth, 2) self-exciting branching process, and 3) the susceptible–infected–resistant (SIR) compartment model. These models have been chosen for their simplicity, minimal number of parameters, and for their ability to describe regional-scale aspects of the pandemic. "

It includes explanations that will help allow scientific researchers to develop insights that may contribute to public health policy making, including contributing to public health forecasting teams. Importantly, the branching process model that we detail is relatively new and underutilized in epidemiology. It provides a method for quantitatively estimating dynamic reproduction numbers, which can be critical in assessing the impact of distancing measures over time. The results from the parsimonious models presented here are consistent with recent analyses from public health officials in California (16) and with the original Imperial College model (3). We present examples of forecasts for viral transmission in the United States.

For the COVID-19 outbreak, exponential growth is seen in data from multiple countries (Fig. 1), with remarkably similar doubling times in the early stages of the epidemic. For COVID-19, we expect an exponential growth phase during the first 15 to 20 d of the outbreak in the absence of public health interventions such as social distancing, isolation, or quarantine. This estimate is based on patient data from the Wuhan outbreak, which indicate that the average time from illness onset to death or discharge is between 17 and 21 d for hospitalized patients (20, 21).

This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we present scenarios of no social distancing vs. short-term social distancing with parameters from Table 1 for death data up through the end of March, fit to the SIR model. We caution that the goal of these scenarios is not to produce highly accurate percentages but rather, to present scenarios under different basic assumptions that illustrate the usefulness of social distancing measures and the potential danger in easing them too soon. For the New York state scenario, with R0 presumed to decrease by a factor of two with distancing measures, the outbreak is not completely controlled by distancing, and the number of infections continues to rise to approximately 10% by mid-April. In contrast, without distancing measures the scenario shows four times that number of infected individuals by ",

Discussion Our analysis, employing parsimonious models, illustrates several key points. 1) The reproduction number R is highly variable both over time and by location, and this variability is compounded by distancing measures. These variations can be calculated using a stochastic model, and lower R is critical to decreasing strains on health care systems and to creating time to develop effective vaccines and antiviral therapies. 2) Mortality data and confirmed case data have statistics that vary by location and by time depending on testing and on accurate accounting of deaths due to the disease. Differences in collection methods and in the accuracy of morbidity and mortality data can lead to different projected outcomes. 3) Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and shelter in place orders offer an important means of reducing the virus's reproduction number.

    "pre_context": "in many cases these are not strong indicators. These models have several sources of uncertainty, including parameter uncertainty, variation based on data or model type used, and most importantly, uncertainty in the severity and length of social distancing measures, which can change the peak date by months or even create multiple peaks. This variability in outcomes highlights the challenges of modeling and forecasting the course of a pandemic during its early stages and with only limited data. This uncertainty is a major challenge for policy makers, who must consider the social and economic consequences of disruptive public health interventions while recognizing that relaxing them may swiftly lead to the reemergence of a devastating disease. Materials and Methods Relation between the Exponential Model and Compartment Models. The exponential model is appropriate during the first stages of the outbreak, when recoveries and deaths are negligible: in this case, the SIR compartment model can be directly reduced to an exponential model. If we assume S ≈ N in Eq. 6, then dI(t)/dt ≈ (β − γ)I, with the exponential solution I(t) = I0eαt with α = β − γ and I0 the initial number of infections. We expect at very early times t (cid:28) 1/γ that the recovery will lag infections so one might see α ∼ β at very early times and then reduce to α ∼ β − γ after t > 1/γ. Reports and graphs disseminated by the media typically report cumulative infections, which include recoveries and deaths. Using the SIR model, the total cumulative infections are Ic(t) = I(t) + R(t) and evolve as dIc(t)/dt = βsI. Integrating this, we see that Ic likewise grows exponentially with the same rate α = β − γ. An important observation is that the doubling time for cumulative infections [Td = ln(2)/α] will change during the early times, with a shorter doubling time when t (cid:28) 1/γ and a longer doubling time when t > 1/γ. Relation between the HawkesN and SIR Models. Following refs. 35 and 51, first a stochastic SIR model can be defined where a counting process ",
    "post_context": " tracks the total number of infections up to time t, N is the population size, and S(t) is the number of susceptible individuals. The process satisfies P(dC(t) = 1) = βS(t)I(t)dt/N + o(dt) P(dR(t) = 1) = γI(t)dt + o(dt), which then gives the rate of new infections and new recoveries as (35) λI(t) = βS(t)I(t)/N, λR(t) = γI(t). It is shown in ref. 51 that the continuum limit of the counting process approaches the solution to the SIR model in Eq. 6. Furthermore, for an exponential kernel w(t) in the HawkesN model in Eq. 5 with parameter γ and constant reproduction number (R0), then E[λI(t)] = λH(t) where µ = 0, β = R0γ (ref. 35 has further details). Fitting the SIR, SEIR, and Branching Process Models. The parameters for SIR and SEIR in Table 1 were found using maximum Poisson likelihood regression (as in ref. 43 for death data from the 1918 pandemic in US cities) via grid search with ranges I0 ∈ [.005, .1], R0 ∈ [1.5, 5], γ ∈ [.01, .2], and µ ∈ [.01, .4]. The branching process was fit using a nonparametric expectation maximization algorithm, the details of which can be found in ref. 18. Models were fit to empirical new infections per day or new mortality counts per day. We assumed that 1% of those labeled as resistant in the simulations were fatal cases. For morality rates in the range of 0.3 to 3%, the peak date changes by up to 2 wk. Data quality is an issue during the COVID-19 pandemic due to lack of uniform testing. Uncertainty in estimates of the total number infected leads to uncertainty in forecasting results. The likelihood is somewhat flat at the maximum for models in Table 1, with multiple parameter combinations yielding plausible fits. Fitting SIR type models is known to be challenging due to parameter identifiability issues (52, 53). However, the peak date only varies by 1 to 3 d for parameters within two units of the maximum log likelihood.

Materials and Methods Relation between the Exponential Model and Compartment Models. The exponential model is appropriate during the first stages of the outbreak, when recoveries and deaths are negligible: in this case, the SIR compartment model can be directly reduced to an exponential model. If we assume S ≈ N in Eq. 6, then dI(t)/dt ≈ (β − γ)I, with the exponential solution I(t) = I0eαt with α = β − γ and I0 the initial number of infections. We expect at very early times t (cid:28) 1/γ that the recovery will lag infections so one might see α ∼ β at very early times and then reduce to α ∼ β − γ after t > 1/γ. Reports and graphs disseminated by the media typically report cumulative infections, which include recoveries and deaths. Using the SIR model, the total cumulative infections are Ic(t) = I(t) + R(t) and evolve as dIc(t)/dt = βsI. Integrating this, we see that Ic likewise grows exponentially with the same rate α = β − γ. An important observation is that the doubling time for cumulative infections [Td = ln(2)/α] will change during the early times, with a shorter doubling time when t (cid:28) 1/γ and a longer doubling time when t > 1/γ. Relation between the HawkesN and SIR Models. Following refs. 35 and 51, first a stochastic SIR model can be defined where a counting process Ic(t) = N − S(t) tracks the total number of infections up to time t, N is the population size, and S(t) is the number of susceptible individuals. The process satisfies P(dC(t) = 1) = βS(t)I(t)dt/N + o(dt) P(dR(t) = 1) = γI(t)dt + o(dt), which then gives the rate of new infections and new recoveries as (35) λI(t) = βS(t)I(t)/N, λR(t) = γI(t).

Of the models presented here, only the point process model tracks the reproductive number changing over time (although compartmental models can be modified to do the same). Dynamic change in the reproductive number is the major challenge in forecasting such a pandemic. Some new approaches to forecasting long-term trends in the COVID-19 pandemic attempt to address this concern by fitting curves in countries in the later stages of spread (after social distancing) and then applying those fitted models to regions in earlier stages (15). The long-term SIR curves in Fig. 3 are idealized counterfactuals in the event of no social distancing, rather than forecasts of the actual peak date and total infected. Moreover, in the absence of distancing policies, people may still choose to distance out of fear driven by an upswing in recent deaths, as was modeled in ref. 43 in the ",
    "post_context": " pandemic. The models presented here are parsimonious, making a variety of assumptions in order to increase understanding and to avoid overfitting the limited and incomplete data available; more complex models have been introduced and are currently in use (3, 13). Even with these simple models, however, the parameters obtained from our fits (Table 1) can vary significantly for a given location. Although we have in each case determined which of these fits appears to have most validity, in many cases these are not strong indicators. These models have several sources of uncertainty, including parameter uncertainty, variation based on data or model type used, and most importantly, uncertainty in the severity and length of social distancing measures, which can change the peak date by months or even create multiple peaks. This variability in outcomes highlights the challenges of modeling and forecasting the course of a pandemic during its early stages and with only limited data. This uncertainty is a major challenge for policy makers, who must consider the social and economic consequences of disruptive public health interventions while recognizing that relaxing them may swiftly lead to the reemergence of a devastating disease. Materials and Methods Relation between the Exponential Model and Compartment Models.
