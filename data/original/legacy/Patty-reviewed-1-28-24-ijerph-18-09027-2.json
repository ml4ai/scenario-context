Using an SEIRS model, we consider a third scenario taking into account time-limited immunity. Results from simulating these 3 scenarios would hopefully shed light on the effects of delaying the usage of masks and how the containment of epidemic could have been more effective in Singapore. To model the pandemic from a macroscopic view point, we use modified versions of the model, which consists of a number of compartments described by a system of differential equations in Sections 2 and 3. To solve these equations, we implemented the model in Python using the Odeint package. We then modify the Delay of Mask Enforcement by plotting several data sets and recording the resulting Maximum Infection Value predicted by our model. This was performed over 3 different scenarios: • • • Scenario 1: The first scenario considers the most basic case of complete compliance of the masking enforcement, from the day it was enforced throughout its duration. It also does not account for time-limited immunity [10], where infected individuals become susceptible again after a period of time. Scenario 2: The second scenario closely resembles the first, but with the addition of gradual noncompliance of the masking enforcement. The root of noncompliance stems from either lack of medical knowledge, wishful thinking that the pandemic will magically disappear, selfish behaviour of individuals, pandemic fatigue etc. Here, we assume that onset of the noncompliance is triggered by an event, for instance, changes in government policies. As an illustration, the Singapore government announced the Phase 2 of its gradual reopening plan on ",
    "post_context": " (154 days after the first case in Singapore) where members of the public were allowed to visit shopping malls and dine-in at food establishments, it was observed that a minority of individuals did not comply with the masking regulations. Scenario 3: The third scenario is almost identical to the first, but now accounts for time-limited immunity. After 90 days, it has been shown that a recovered individual may become susceptible to the virus again [11]. This scenario serves as a comparison to investigate if the immunity factor would worsen the effects of the delay of mask enforcement on the maximum infected values. Here we highlight that effective control of the COVID19 pandemic cannot be achieved by the universal masking enforcement alone, but a strong combination factors such as social distancing enforcement, rapid roll-out of mass testing, lockdowns and extensive quarantine measures.

The SEIR model consists of several compartments, namely Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed. We expand the model by further differentiating the Removed compartment into 2 new Recovered and Death compartments. The flow between the 5 components are described by the following 5 differential equations: dS(t) dt = −βI(t) S(t) N dE(t) dt = βI(t) S(t) N − δE(t) dI(t) dt = δE(t) − (1 − α)γI(t) − αρI(t) dR(t) dt dD(t) dt = (1 − α)γI(t) = αρI(t) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) where N is the total population, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) and D(t), are the number of people susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and dead on day t. β is the expected number of people an infected person infects per day, γ is the proportion of recovery per day, δ is the incubation period, α is the fatality rate due to the infection and ρ is the inverse of the average number of days for an infected person to die if he does not recover. 3.

Figure 1 shows an example of such logistic function, where for the case of Singapore, we set t0 = 89, since the policy of compulsory mask wearing was implemented 89 days after the first case was uncovered. This model is used in both Scenarios 1 and 3. Figure 1. Logistic function to model the infection rate due to compulsory mask wearing m(t) for Scenarios 1 and 3. To model the gradual noncompliance of universal masking, we make a modification to Equation (9). m(t) = βs − βc 1 + e−k1(−t+t0) + βc − βnc 1 + e−k2(−t+t1) + βnc (10) As individuals began to engage in noncompliance out of complacency and pandemic fatigue, the infection rate, βnc, would thus increase slightly. Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from βc → βnc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy. Figure 2 illustrates one such example, where we have βnc = 0.5 and t1 = 154, taken in context to Singapore's shift from a full lockdown to gradual resumption of everyday activities 154 days after the first case. The infection rate βnc is expected to be lower than βs as even with the complacency and fatigue, as there is now a greater situational awareness of the severity and the population in general will take a more cautious outlook compared to pre-pandemic days.

Effects of Delay of Mask Enforcement on Maximum Infected Value We further investigate this relationship by explicitly considering how the delay in mask enforcement will impact the corresponding Maximum Infected Values. Figure 4 shows the results of different enforcement delay values and their corresponding maximum infected values. Here, we considered 3 scenarios described in the introduction. Figure 4. Maximum infection against delay in mask enforcement for Scenario 2: SEIR with full compliance and Scenario 3: SEIRS with time-limited immunity. Figure 4 suggests a transition from low maximum infection of about 15–16% to a high maximum infection of about 31%, with the transition occurring at between a delay of 80 to 100 days. This transition manifests itself as a point of inflection of the graphs in Figure 4, occurring at about 100 days of delay. Interestingly, this suggests that delaying public masking enforcement for greater than about 100 days results in the significant reduction in "

Concluding Remarks At present, compulsory mask wearing has been widely accepted as a means of controlling COVID-19 infection by reducing the infection rate through aerosol means. With this study, we hope to shed some light on whether the delay in enforcement of compulsory mask wearing will have detrimental effects on infection control when studied in isolation. Based on our results, it appears that a delay of 100 days and above would result in a transition where enforcement of public masking alone would result in little effect on the Maximum Infected Value. We considered 3 scenarios over 2 varied mathematical models. This result is consistent regardless of the level of compliance of the population, or the presence of time-limited immunity. Yet, if implemented early, our model shows that the Maximum Infected Values can be kept relatively low and under control, even after accounting for time-limited immunity and some level of noncompliance. We would like to point out that several studies on the effectiveness of community use of face masks. In one study carried out in the United States [28], the authors compared the percentage change in daily case rates between states enforcing public masking and "

While we acknowledge the limitations due to the rapidly changing nature of the ongoing pandemic and the presence of many contributing factors, some which are difficult to quantify, we cannot resort to waiting for sufficient data to present itself before drawing concrete solutions, as warned by Cheong and Jones [27], if we are to reduce its impact. Analysing the results, as we may intuitively anticipate, given the increased infectivity of the new strain, the Maximum Infected Numbers obtained were of a slightly greater magnitude compared to the original model. Surprisingly, we observe the same consistent trend across all the 6 scenarios, comprising a point of inflection beyond which, the effectiveness of public masking is significantly reduced. The key difference to note is that the point of inflection occurs for a smaller value of delay in enforcement, approximately 80 days as opposed to the 100 days of our initial model.

Concluding Remarks At present, compulsory mask wearing has been widely accepted as a means of controlling COVID-19 infection by reducing the infection rate through aerosol means. With this study, we hope to shed some light on whether the delay in enforcement of compulsory mask wearing will have detrimental effects on infection control when studied in isolation. Based on our results, it appears that a delay of 100 days and above would result in a transition where enforcement of public masking alone would result in little effect on the Maximum Infected Value. We considered 3 scenarios over 2 varied mathematical models. This result is consistent regardless of the level of compliance of the population, or the presence of time-limited immunity. Yet, if implemented early, our model shows that the Maximum Infected Values can be kept relatively low and under control, even after accounting for time-limited immunity and some level of noncompliance. We would like to point out that several studies on the effectiveness of community use of face masks.
