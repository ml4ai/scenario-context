Introduction Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan City in December of 2019, numerous model predictions on the COVID-19 epidemics in Wuhan and other parts of China have been reported. These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic, and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city. © 2020 The Authors.

Introduction Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan City in December of 2019, numerous model predictions on the COVID-19 epidemics in Wuhan and other parts of China have been reported. These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in ",

In early December 2019, a novel coronavirus, later labelled as COVID-19, caused an outbreak in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and it has further spread to other parts of China and many other countries in the world. By January 31, the global confirmed cases have reached 9,776 with a death toll of 213, and the WHO declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (WHO, 2020). By February 9, the global death toll has climbed to 811, surpassing the total death toll of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and the confirmed cases continued to climb globally. As governments and public agencies in China and other impacted countries respond to the outbreaks, it is crucial for modelers to estimate the severity of the epidemic in terms of the total number of infected, total number of confirmed cases, total deaths, and the basic reproduction number, and to predict the time course of the epidemic, the arrival of its peak time, and total duration.

By February 9, the global death toll has climbed to 811, surpassing the total death toll of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and the confirmed cases continued to climb globally. As governments and public agencies in China and other impacted countries respond to the outbreaks, it is crucial for modelers to estimate the severity of the epidemic in terms of the total number of infected, total number of confirmed cases, total deaths, and the basic reproduction number, and to predict the time course of the epidemic, the arrival of its peak time, and total duration. Such information can help the public health agencies make informed decisions. * Corresponding author. ",

The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people. The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 (cid:1) 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ratio r can be as small as 1=100, based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, IðtÞ, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated ",
    "post_context": " has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998). It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration. Different choices of parameter values with the same good fit to the data can lead to very different model predictions. The ways in which nonidentifiability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly influences the reliability of model predictions. The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidentifiability issue, since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm. These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima given nonidentifiability. Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures based on Bayesian inference often fail to converge to the target posterior distribution in the presence of nonidentifiability, and can produce best-fit parameter values with unreliable credible intervals, since these often relies on elementary MCMC algorithms. Elementary MCMC algorithms converge very slowly given a very skewed posterior distribution. In our study, we used an improved model calibration method using Bayesian inference and affine invariant ensemble MCMC algorithm that can ensure fast convergence to the target posterior distribution when facing nonidentifiability, and provide more reliable credible intervals and model predictions.

For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020), but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population. The transfer diagrams for both models are shown in Fig. 1. The biological meaning of all model parameters are given in Table 1 and Table 2. A key assumption in both models is that deaths occurring in the S, E, and I compartments are negligible during the period of model predictions. (4 months). Since we use the newly confirmed case data for model calibration, which is matched to the rI term in both models, the death term in the R compartment has no effect on our model fitting.

There are six parameters to be estimated for the SEIR model: transfer rate ε from E to I, the initial population size E0 for the latent compartment E on January 21, 2019, and b, r, I0, and q ¼ 1=t. Since it was announced at a news conference by the mayor of Wuhan on January 23 that 5 million people have left the city by that date, we set the total population N ¼ Sþ Iþ R in Wuhan on January 21 to the conservative estimate of 6 million. We used the same uniform distributions over the initial range of parameters as the priors for both models, as given in Tables 1 and 2. The affine invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to produce posterior distributions for all estimated parameters. From these posterior distributions, we obtain the best-fit values and the 95% credible intervals, as given in Table 1 for the SIR model (2) and in Table 2 for the SEIR model (3). 3.3. Comparing SIR and SEIR models Using the calibration results for both the SIR and SEIR models in Section 3.3, their corrected Akaike Information Criterion AICc are calculated as 174 and 186, respectively. The difference D ¼ 186 (cid:1) 174 ¼ 12 is sufficiently large and this implies that using the SEIR model (3) will produce a significant loss of information in comparison to using the SIR model (2). Accordingly, our further investigation will be carried out using the SIR model (2). 4. Nonidentifiability: linkage between transmission rate b and diagnosis rate r Based on our calibration results of the SIR model in Section 3.3, we detected a linkage between the transmission rate b and the diagnosis rate r. In Fig. 2 (a), we show the projection of the unnormalized posterior distribution in the b-r parameter Fig. 2. Linkage between ",

These measures have a direct impact on two parameters in our SIR model (2): reducing the transmission rate b and increasing the diagnosis rate r: It is difficult to estimate the exact impacts on these parameters by these measures. We incorporated several likely scenarios of the effects of these measures by adjusting our baseline estimates of b and r and we plotted the resulting time courses in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6 (a), we see that a combination of a 10% reduction in the transmission rate b and a 90% increase in the diagnosis rate r can effectively stop the epidemic in its tracks, force the newly diagnosed cases to decline, and significantly shorten the duration of the epidemic. 7. Potential of a second outbreak in Wuhan after the return-to-work With newly diagnosed cases on the decline in Wuhan and other cities in China since February 14, an urgent task for the authorities is to decide when to allow people to go back to work. Without lifting the ban on traffic in and out of the city, we tested three hypotheses of allowing people to return to work in Wuhan at three different dates: February 24, March 2, and March 31. As shown in Fig. 7, our results predict a significant second outbreak after the return-to-work day. 8.

Impacts of more strict quarantine measures in Wuhan after February 7 After February 7, 2020, Wuhan implemented more strict quarantine measures that included the following: locking down residential buildings and compounds, strict self quarantine for families, door-to-door inspection for suspected cases, quarantining suspected cases and close contacts in newly established hospitals and other quarantine spaces including vacated hotels and university dormitories. The goal of these measures was to reduce transmissions within family clusters and residential compounds. These measures have a direct impact on two parameters in our SIR model (2): reducing the transmission rate b and increasing the diagnosis rate r: It is difficult to estimate the exact impacts on these parameters by these measures. We incorporated several likely scenarios of the effects of these measures by adjusting our baseline estimates of b and r and we plotted the resulting time courses in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6 (a), we see that a combination of a 10% reduction in the transmission rate b and a 90% increase in the diagnosis rate r can effectively stop the epidemic in its tracks, force the newly diagnosed cases to decline, and significantly shorten the duration of the epidemic. 7.

Conclusions The COVID-19 epidemics have presented China and many other countries in the world with an unprecedented public health challenge in the modern era, with a significant impact on health and public health systems, human lives and national and world economies.

The reliability in model predictions depends on how rigorously the nonidentifiability is addressed in model calibration and on the choice of parameter values. We demonstrated that Bayesian inference and an improved Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the affine invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, can significantly reduce the wide parameter ranges in the uniform prior and produce workable credible intervals, even in the presence of nonidentifiability. We showed that the estimated credible intervals for the parameters are sufficiently small to allow our credible interval for the peak time to fall within a week. We have further demonstrated that the peak time of the epidemic is much less sensitive to parameter variations than the peak values and the scale of the epidemic. This was also observed in our previous work on predicting seasonal influenza for the Province of Alberta. We estimated the impact of the Wuhan lockdown and traffic restrictions in the city after January 23 and before February 6, 2020. We show that if the more restrictive control and prevention measures were not implemented in the city, the epidemic would peak between the end of February and first week of March of 2020.
