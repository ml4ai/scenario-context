The proposed COVID-19 compartment model Based on a 2016 model [10] , and taking into account the ex- istence of super-spreaders in the family of corona virus [11] , we propose  a  new  epidemiological  compartment  model  that  takes into account the super-spreading phenomenon of some individu- als. Moreover, we consider a fatality compartment, related to death due to the virus infection.

Here κ is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infec- tious (symptomatic, super-spreaders or asymptomatic); ρ 1  is the proportion of progression from exposed class E to symptomatic in- fectious class I; ρ 2 is a relative very low rate at which exposed in- dividuals become super-spreaders while 1 − ρ1 − ρ2 is the progres- sion from exposed to asymptomatic class; γ a is the average rate at which symptomatic and super-spreaders individuals become hos- i is the recovery rate without being hospitalized; γ r is pitalized; γ the recovery rate of hospitalized patients; and ",

The transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals has been modeled in this way since it was not apparent their behavior. Indeed, at present, this question is a controversial issue for epidemiologists. A flowchart of model (1) is presented in Fig. 1 . 3. Qualitative analysis of the model One of the most significant thresholds when studying infectious disease models, which quantifies disease invasion or extinction in a population, is the basic reproduction number [12] . In this section we obtain the basic reproduction number for our model (1) and study the locally asymptotically stability of its disease free equilib- rium (see Theorem 1 ). 3.1. The basic reproduction number The basic reproduction number, as a measure for disease spread in a population, plays an important role in the course and control of an ongoing outbreak. It can be understood as the average num- ber of cases one infected individual generates, over the course of its infectious period, in an otherwise uninfected population. Using the next generation matrix approach outlined in van den Driess- che and Watmough [13] to our model (1) , the basic reproduction number can be computed by considering the below generation ma- trices F and V , that is, the Jacobian matrices associated to the rate of appearance of new infections and the net rate out of the corre- sponding compartments, respectively, ⎡ 0  β ⎢ ⎣ 0  0 0  0 0  0 κ J F = J V = ⎤ ⎥ ⎦  and βl  β (cid:3) 0 0 0 0 0 0 ⎡ 0 −κρ1  (cid:7) i ⎢ ⎣ −κρ2 0 0 0 0 0 0  (cid:7) p 0 −γa  −γa  (cid:7) h ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ , where (cid:7) i = γa + γi + δi , (cid:7) p = γa + γi + δp and (cid:7) h = γr + δ h .

For example, ϒ R 0 θ = +1 means that increasing (decreas- ing) θ by a given percentage increases (decreases) always R 0  by that  same  percentage.  The  estimation  of  a  sensitive  parameter should be carefully done, since a small perturbation in such pa- rameter leads to relevant quantitative changes. On the other hand, the estimation of a parameter with a rather small value for the sensitivity index does not require as much attention to estimate, because  a  small  perturbation  in  that  parameter  leads  to  small changes. 1  and δ From Table 2 , we conclude that the most sensitive parameters 0 of the COVID-19 model (1) are to the basic reproduction number R β, ρ i . In concrete, an increase of the value of β will in- crease the basic reproduction number by 96.3% and this happens, in a similar way, for the parameter ρ 1 .

    "pre_context": " point of our simulations is 4 January 2020 (day 0), when the Chinese authorities informed about the new virus [20] , with already 6 confirmed cases in one day. From this period up to January 19, there is less information about the number of people contracting the disease. Only on January 20, we have the report [21] , with 1460 new reported cases in that day and 26 the dead. Thus, the infection gained much more attention from 21 January 2020, with 1739 confirmed cases and 38 the dead, up to 4 March 2020, when the numbers in that day were as low as 11 and 7, re- spectively infected and dead, after a pick of 3892 confirmed cases on 27 January 2020 and a pick of 254 dead on 4 February 2020. Here we follow the data of the daily reports published by [5] . We show that our COVID-19 model describes well the real data of daily confirmed cases during the 2 months outbreak (66 days to be pre- cise, from January 4 to March 9, 2020). The total population of Wuhan is about 11 million. During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a restriction of  movements of  in- dividuals due to quarantine in the city.  As a consequence, there was  a  limitation  on  the  spread  of  the  disease.  In  agreement,  in our model we consider, as the total population under study, N = 110 0 0 0 0 0 / 250 .

This is in agreement with our computations of the basic reproduc- tion number in Section 4 that, surprisingly, is obtained less than 1. Moreover, it is worth to mention that our model fits also enough well the real data of daily confirmed deaths, as shown in Fig. 3 . Our theoretical findings and numerical results adapt well to the real data and it reflects or reflected the reality in Wuhan, China. "
