When data-driven, these approaches have highlighted the importance of the social, demographic, and economic characteristics of the population in determining the actual mesh of contacts underlying disease spreading among individuals. For this reason, a broad range of methodologies have been used to including surveys9–12, contact study human-mixing patterns, diaries13–19, wearable sensors20,21, analysis of time-use data22, development of synthetic populations23–25, and mixed approaches for instance integrating diary-based contact data with timeuse data26,27 or combining contact data with modeling techniques26,28,29. However, each methodology has different limitations and assumptions because contact patterns among individuals vary according to the geographical scale (from census blocks to the national level), the disease under consideration, and the detailed socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the population. Here, we present a data-driven approach to generate effective descriptions of complex contact patterns that can be used to inform infectious disease modeling approaches, including the widely adopted compartmental modeling framework. We make use of highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data from publicly available sources on key socio-demographic features (e.g., age structure, household composition and members' age gaps, employment rates, school structure) to construct synthetic populations of interacting agents, each one representing a hypothetical in the real population.

The resulting synthetic populations are used to generate age-stratified contact matrices for the most common social settings, in which individuals spend their time interacting with each other (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and the general community). The resulting contact matrices capture differences at the subnational level that reflect the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries. This approach allows us to provide a mesoscopic description of the human contact patterns that can be used in the mathematical and computational analysis of infectious disease spread (see Fig. 1). To illustrate the importance of considering national and subnational heterogeneities in the analysis of infectious disease epidemiology, we construct the contact matrix relevant for airborne infectious diseases by calibrating the combination of settingspecific (household, workplace, school) contact matrices using as ground truth seven diary-based contact matrices (six European countries14 and Russia18).

We make use of highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data from publicly available sources on key socio-demographic features (e.g., age structure, household composition and members' age gaps, employment rates, school structure) to construct synthetic populations of interacting agents, each one representing a hypothetical in the real population.

The resulting synthetic populations are used to generate age-stratified contact matrices for the most common social settings, in which individuals spend their time interacting with each other (i.e., households, schools, workplaces, and the general community).

This approach allows us to provide a mesoscopic description of the human contact patterns that can be used in the mathematical and computational analysis of infectious disease spread (see Fig. 1). To illustrate the importance of considering national and subnational heterogeneities in the analysis of infectious disease epidemiology, we construct the contact matrix relevant for airborne infectious diseases by calibrating the combination of settingspecific (household, workplace, school) contact matrices using as ground truth seven diary-based contact matrices (six European countries14 and Russia18).

Results We use a data-driven computational approach to infer the contact networks in the social settings where people interact and spend most of their time. In particular, we focus on four social settings (household, school, workplace, and the general community), which are particularly relevant for influenza transmission7,33. To reconstruct the synthetic population in each context we use a wide variety of national and subnational micro-level, census, and demographic data that provide the separate characteristics of the population, and the association of multiple characteristics. Micro-level data drawn from socio-demographic surveys are especially useful as no assumptions on the rules of disaggregation are required (the data are already on the required level of disaggregation). Contacts between individuals in the real-world populations are inferred by analysis of the generated data-driven synthetic networks by measuring the "

The same feature was observed in ref. 19 for Zimbabwe. Even within the same country, contact patterns may be markedly different. Figure 2a shows the age-mixing patterns within households for two different provinces of China: Beijing and Guizhou. While the household contact patterns in Beijing show a clear signal of the \"One-child policy\", Guizhou shows the presence of multigenerational families, as well as an increased presence of multiple children living in the same household. This can be traced back to the fact that the Guizhou Province is characterized by a large frequency of minority groups and the \"One-child policy\" was less strictly applied for minorities. Figure 2b, c shows the inferred contact matrices in the school and workplace settings for China, the United States, and India. In both settings, the age-mixing patterns vary strongly, reflecting differences in the educational systems, and economic conditions unique to each location. For all locations in our study, the school setting consistently exhibits the highest frequencies of contact between children and young adults attending school together.

The increased frequency of contact between adults of similar ages along the main diagonal of the household contact matrix represents couples of similar ages living together, while the bands of high frequency above and below the main diagonal indicate contact between parents and children. While most locations share these overall features, the contact matrices show different age-mixing patterns. For instance, in China (Fig. 2a), the lower frequency of contact between children within households is the reflection of the country's so-called \"One-child policy\". The policy, enacted in 1979 up to 2016, has resulted in over a generation of many Chinese youths growing up without siblings, and hence having less contact on average with other children in this setting. This is a stark contrast with the United States and India (Fig. 2a), where the presence of multiple children born to a family results in an increased frequency of contact between this age group in the household matrix. The presence of multigenerational families in countries like India is also evident from the increased frequency of contact between all age groups, notably between the elderly (60 years and older) and young children. The same feature was observed in ref. 19 for Zimbabwe. Even within the same country, contact patterns may be markedly different. Figure 2a shows the age-mixing patterns within households for two different provinces of China: Beijing and Guizhou. While the household contact patterns in Beijing show a clear signal of the \"One-child policy\", Guizhou shows the presence of multigenerational families, as well as an increased presence of multiple children living in the same household.

For this reason, as a validation of this calibration method, in Fig. 3a we report the correlation between the resulting synthetic matrices for France, Japan, and the Shanghai Province of China and the available empirical matrices for these additional locations30–32.

In contrast, most of India, South Africa, and of the territories in Canada, Russia, and Australia have contact patterns noticeably different from those obtained for the state of New York. into after coming Epidemiological relevance. To investigate the effect of the computed contact matrices on infection transmission dynamics, we develop an age-structured SIR model to describe influenza transmission dynamics in the sites considered. The SIR model describes the spread of influenza in terms of the transition of individuals between different epidemiological compartments. Susceptible individuals (i.e., those at risk of acquiring the infection—S) can become infectious (i.e., capable to transmit the infection—I) contact with infectious individuals. Subsequently, infectious individuals recover from the infection and become removed (R) after a certain amount of time (the infectious period). In an age-structured implementation of the model, individuals are now identified also by their age, and the contact matrix is introduced to describe the number of contacts between susceptible individuals of age i and all of their possible infectious contacts of age j2,13 (see \"Methods\" for details). More specifically, we considered a transmission model with identical disease parameters across geographical locations considered in the study. The contact matrices are thus the only factor driving the difference in dynamics and attack rate (total number of infected individuals) of the simulated epidemic. Compared to the case of homogeneous mixing, where all individuals are assumed to be in contact with each other in equal proportions, the inclusion of the contact matrices in the epidemic model consistently yields a lower overall attack rate for all locations (Fig. 6a).

To understand the underlying factors of the observed heterogeneities across geographical locations, we use a linear regression model to compare the attack rates and various sociodemographic features of each location (see Supplementary Information).

A more detailed explanation of the construction of the synthetic population can be found in Supplementary Information together with the results of the comparison between the synthetic and actual population statistics. Construction of age-based contact matrices. We use synthetic contact networks to infer average age-based contact patterns within each social setting. For each location, these age-based contact patterns are encoded in a contact matrix Fk, whose elements Fk ij describes the average frequency of contact between a given individual of age i and individuals of age j in setting k. We focus on 4 social settings: the households (H), schools (S), workplaces (W), and the general community (C). Specifically, here we adopt the frequency-dependent (mass action) transmission model, with the implicit assumption that an increased population density has no effect on the per capita contact rate between individuals45. This choice of modeling mechanism was already proved to represent a good approximation for the description of the transmission patterns of several infectious diseases2. Moreover, it allows us to readily compare epidemiological parameters between social settings and locations with disparate population density, and thus makes for an appropriate framework when modeling the transmission dynamics of heterogeneous populations around the world.
