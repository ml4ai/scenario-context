We developed DELPHI, a novel epidemiological model for predicting detected cases and deaths in the prevaccination era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model allows for underdetection of infections and effects of government interventions. We have applied DELPHI across more than 200 geographical areas since early April 2020 and recorded 6% and 11% two-week, out-of-sample median mean absolute percentage error on predicting cases and deaths, respectively.

We further illustrate two downstream applications of DELPHI, enabled by the model's flexible parametric formulation of the effect of government interventions. First, we quantify the impact of government interventions on the pandemic's spread. We predict, that in the absence of any interventions, more than 14 million individuals would have perished by May 17, 2020, whereas 280,000 deaths could have been avoided if interventions around the world had started one week earlier.

DELPHI compares favorably with other top COVID-19 epidemiological models and predicted in 2020 the large-scale epidemics in many areas, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia, months in advance. We further illustrate two downstream applications of DELPHI, enabled by the model's flexible parametric formulation of the effect of government interventions. First, we quantify the impact of government interventions on the pandemic's spread. We predict, that in the absence of any interventions, more than 14 million individuals would have perished by May 17, 2020, whereas 280,000 deaths could have been avoided if interventions around the world had started one week earlier. Furthermore, we find that mass gathering restrictions and school closings were associated with the largest average reductions in infection rates at 29:9 6 6:9% and 17:3 6 6:7%, respectively. The most stringent policy, stay at home, was associated with an average reduction in infection rate by 74:4 6 3:7% from baseline across countries that implemented it.

For a comprehensive review of COVID-19 models, see Dean et al. (2020). DELPHI is a mechanistic compartmental model.

Parameters are fit by using bounds of plus/minus 6 20% deviation around the latest value for TNC and bounds of 6 50% deviation for DA.

We would illustrate this with a specific example focused on the region of Georgia. Table 1 shows the parameters and their bounds for the update on October 23, 2020, when we utilized both TNC and DA.

Therefore, retraining the model was triggered once a new wave that has lasted for at least one month was detected by tracking the data.

The rationale behind this heuristic is that, usually, stricter measures are enacted once a new wave is evident and on the rise. As an example, for the United States, in July 2020 retraining was triggered, with the new training period starting from June 2020, and similarly in November 2020, with a start from October 2020. We specifically exclude historical data starting before an area recorded more than 100 cases for numerical stability and to exclude sporadic outbreaks before the actual epidemic. the parameters more significantly if To optimize over the highly nonconvex search space, we utilize both a local truncated Newton algorithm (TNC) (Nocedal and Wright 2006) and a global optimization method of dual annealing (DA) (Xiang et al. 1997).

DELPHI's goal is not to infer the number of all, detected and undetected, infections. If one wished to point-identify the true detection probability, more and different input data, such as random serology testing, would be required. However, such data were, and still are, very sparse, most often pertaining to specific cities and counties (see Bendavid et al. 2020, Doi et al. 2021, Sood et al. 2020, and Streeck et al. 2020 for examples) and only occasionally to countries (mostly in Europe, (see, e.g., Erikstrup et al. 2020 and Wise 2020). 2.2. Separation of Recovery and Deaths DELPHI's compartmental structure allows for different transition rates for recovery and death processes − dI dt (cid:2) −(ν + (cid:1)τ)I, where ν is the rate of recovery and τ ",
    "post_context": ". This implies a fixed probability of death equal ˜τ to ν+˜τ. By contrast, the structure in Figure 1(c) decouples the probability of death (cid:1)µ from the transition rates (cid:1)τ and ν. 2.3. Modeling Effect of Increasing Government Response As shown in Figure 2, DELPHI models different phases for the government response during a pandemic by means of the area-specific function γ(t) in (1), which includes sigmoid (arctan) and exponential terms. The concave-convex nature of the arctan term accounts for the first three phases. The early, concave part models initial limited changes in behavior in response to early information, when most people continue business-asusual activities. The transition from the concave to the convex part of the curve quantifies the sharp decline in infection rate as policies go into full force and people's behavior changes sharply. The latter convex part of the curve models a flattening out of the response as the government measures reach saturation, representing the diminishing marginal returns in the decline of infection rate. The exponential term models a potential resurgence in cases, for instance, due to premature relaxation of societal restrictions or some change in behavior. In (1), parameters (cid:1)t0 and (cid:1) k control the timing of such measures and the rapidity of their penetration, (cid:1) whereas the (cid:1)c, (cid:6)tjump , d controls the timing, magnitude, and duration of a resurgence.

Although in reality, the likelihood that a patient will be identified through testing varies across areas and over time, DEL- PHI treats the probability of detection, pd, as a global constant nuisance parameter. The probability pd is not identifiable in each area from the available data, namely detected cases and deaths. Fixing it to 20% (which represents average estimates in different countries from the early studies) is, in practice, no different from assuming other reasonable estimates that vary by area. The model has enough degrees of freedom to adjust the values of other area-specific, partially identified parameters (e.g., the area-specific reproduction rate). Allowing both the detection probability and the reproduction rate to vary by area or over time offers no additional advantage for predicting detected cases and deaths and may occasionally lead to overfitting issues (see, e.g., Lourenc¸o et al. 2020). In sensitivity analyses (Section 3.3), we show that predictions of detected cases and deaths are robust to moderate deviations (cid:2) 20%. We also modeled the detecfrom the value of pd tion probability as functions of observable data, such as the number of tests that were administered over time in a country, but this did not improve the out-ofsample empirical performance of the model.

The early, concave part models initial limited changes in behavior in response to early information, when most people continue business-asusual activities. The transition from the concave to the convex part of the curve quantifies the sharp decline in infection rate as policies go into full force and people's behavior changes sharply. The latter convex part of the curve models a flattening out of the response as the government measures reach saturation, representing the diminishing marginal returns in the decline of infection rate.

    "pre_context": "ymptoms that are severe enough to prompt them to seek testing or care, some may attribute any symptoms to another infection, such as the common cold, and some may refrain from getting tested for other reasons (e.g., to avoid losing time from work). Although in reality, the likelihood that a patient will be identified through testing varies across areas and over time, DEL- PHI treats the probability of detection, pd, as a global constant nuisance parameter. The probability pd is not identifiable in each area from the available data, namely detected cases and deaths. Fixing it to 20% (which represents average estimates in different countries from the early studies) is, in practice, no different from assuming other reasonable estimates that vary by area. The model has enough degrees of freedom to adjust the values of other area-specific, partially identified parameters (e.g., the area-specific reproduction rate). Allowing both the detection probability and the reproduction rate to vary by area or over time offers no additional advantage for predicting detected cases and deaths and may occasionally lead to overfitting issues (see, e.g., Lourenc¸o et al. 2020). In sensitivity analyses (Section 3.3), we show that predictions of detected cases and deaths are robust to moderate deviations (cid:2) 20%. We also modeled the detecfrom the value of pd tion probability as functions of observable data, such as the number of tests that were administered over time in a country, but this did not improve the out-ofsample empirical performance of the model. DELPHI's goal is not to infer the number of all, detected and undetected, infections. If one wished to point-identify the true detection probability, more and different input data, such as random serology testing, would be required. However, such data were, and still are, very sparse, most often pertaining to specific cities and counties (see Bendavid et al. 2020, Doi et al. 2021, Sood et al. 2020, and Streeck et al. 2020 for examples) and only occasionally to countries (mostly in ",

During the second period, there was a resurgence of the epidemic, the management of the disease was better understood, and new treatment protocols were in place. For both periods, DELPHI seems to predict the epidemic progression relatively well in most areas, with < 10% MAPE on reported cases and < 15% MAPE on reported deaths. The worldwide median MAPE was 5.8% for detected cases and 10.6% for deaths. The areas with the highest MAPE were typically those with the fewest deaths, as shown in the selected examples in Table 2. Analogously, the median RMSE for deaths in both periods was <100 across all regions, which is remarkable given that the RMSE is not scaled by the observed number of deaths and the high number of deaths per region (e.g., by the second period, a majority of areas in North America and Europe were reporting more than 5,000 cumulative deaths). The median RMSE on cases is also remarkable, at just above 2,000 cases in the second period, given the daily median number of recorded cases across all areas (~ 60, 000). The worldwide median MAPE for deaths in the second period is smaller than in the first (4.8% vs. 10.8%, respectively). This may be partially explained by the better fitting of the probability of death (cid:1)µ(t) in the second period, when the cumulative number of deaths was higher and also the higher variability of MAPE when the denominator (observed deaths) is small (analogously to the observation in Table 2).

In the case of Russia, DELPHI was able to predict that the country was going to become a global hotspot as well as to accurately estimate the magnitude of the first wave of the outbreak, even at an early stage of the pandemic (less than 0.025% of the population infected, versus more than 0:16% a month later, which has put the country at the 4th rank worldwide in terms of cumulative number of cases). 3.2.

This demonstrates that the results from the DELPHI model are robust to a moderately large perturbation to the underlying parameters. 4. Applications DELPHI's predictions of the epidemic's trajectory can inform decisions of policymakers and research design, as shown in two selected applications. In the first application, we consider different NPIs to limit social interactions and mixing and extend the DEL- PHI model to evaluate their impact on the trajectory of the epidemic. The second application demonstrates a scenario analysis toolkit that can inform the 193 planning of operations, staffing, inventories, or even the development of research designs. This toolkit was used by Janssen Pharmaceuticals to select candidate sites for their Phase III the single-dose COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.Cov-2.S. trial of 4.1. Application 1: Evaluating Different Government Intervention Scenarios In this section, we extend DELPHI to evaluate the impact of government interventions.

We begin by focusing on the effect of different interventions and then analyze different \"what if\" scenarios. 4.1.1. Effect of Government Interventions. We can use DELPHI to examine the association between five escalating policy categories (1. no measure; 2. restrict travel and work; 3. restrict mass gatherings, travel and work; 4. restrict mass gatherings, schools, travel and work; and 5. stay at home) and the daily infection rate across areas during the first training window ",

For each area, we assign each day in the first training window to one of the five policy categories using data from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (Hale et al. 2021) for countries other than the United States and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (Murray et al. 2020) for U.S. states (detailed correspondence in the e-companion). We assume that each of the five policy categories has a global fixed effect across all areas. We use a two-step approach. First, we estimate the γ(t) function for each area and training window, which captures the net effect of everything that affects infection rates, including government interventions, changes in behavior, workplace policies, etc. In the second step, we treat the γ(t) functions as known and use the presence or absence of the aforementioned five policy categories to explain temporal changes in area-specific infection rates using the algorithm below. For each policy category i (cid:2) 1, : : : , 5 and each area j, we extract the average value of γ(t), ¯γ ij across all times for which policy i was in effect. Then we calculate the residual fraction of infection rate under policy i, pi, compared with the baseline policy of no measure as pi :(cid:2) 1 J (cid:3)J j(cid:2)1 pij (cid:2) 1 J (cid:3)J ¯γ ¯γ j(cid:2)1 ij , 1j where J is the total number of areas we include and pij is the residual fraction of infection rate under policy i for a specific area j. We normalize the residual fraction of infection rates for different areas because different areas have different background infection rates (cid:1)α.

Figure 5, (a) and (b), records the quantile (box and whisker) plots of the absolute difference between the MAPE of the actual model and the perturbed model for six parameters (β, rd, σ, κ, pd, ph), across the 56 areas (50 U.S. states and six countries) for the three prediction dates. We observe that for all six parameters, across both cases and deaths, the effect of the perturbation on the one-month MAPE is relatively small, with interquartile range mostly falling between 6 5% for a perturbation with a standard deviation of 20% of the parameter value. This demonstrates that the results from the DELPHI model are robust to a moderately large perturbation to the underlying parameters. 4. Applications DELPHI's predictions of the epidemic's trajectory can inform decisions of policymakers and research design, as shown in two selected applications. In the first application, we consider different NPIs to limit social interactions and mixing and extend the DEL- PHI model to evaluate their impact on the trajectory of the epidemic. The second application demonstrates a scenario analysis toolkit that can inform the 193 planning of operations, staffing, inventories, or even the development of research designs. This toolkit was used by Janssen Pharmaceuticals to select candidate sites for their Phase III the single-dose COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.Cov-2.S. trial of 4.1. Application 1: Evaluating Different Government Intervention Scenarios In this section, we extend DELPHI to evaluate the impact of government interventions.

This particular period was selected because it encompassed the period of second resurgence in the United States and its decay, making prediction even more difficult. October 2020 was excluded because the CDC ensemble forecast changed its submission and reporting guidelines, prompting submission lapses in many models. We observe that DELPHI consistently achieves low MAPE and that its predictions are stable with a MAPE, never exceeding 3.5% throughout the period. Figure 4(b) further illustrates the performance of DELPHI in comparison with other models by graphing the weekly ranking (with respect to MAPE). We observe that DELPHI consistently outperforms all other models, holds the first rank for six out of 13 weeks, and never drops below rank 4 among the eight models evaluated. 3.3. Sensitivity Analysis We examined the impact on prediction of varying each of the six fixed parameter of DELPHI in univariate sensitivity analyses. For every fixed parameter among β, rd, σ, κ, pd, and ph, we randomly perturbed the parameter by a zero-centered normal noise term ε with standard deviation of 20% of the nominal parameter's absolute value, that is, ε ~ N (0, (0:2 · |param|)2). Then we fit the DELPHI model using data up to a certain prediction date using the perturbed fixed parameter and compared its 30-day out-of-sample MAPE with that of the baseline value. We conducted these sensitivity analyses for all states in the United States and in six countries around the world with large outbreaks (Italy, Spain, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, and Russia) for three prediction dates.

(a) Sensitivity of predictions on cases based on perturbation of key fixed parameters; (b) sensitivity of predictions on deaths based on perturbation of key fixed parameters. The estimated \"effects\" of the five policy categories on infection rates are associations rather than causal estimates in that they may be confounded by other unmeasured or unobservable factors. For example, during the first wave, most governments had not yet implemented a mask mandate, and thus we did not include masks in the policy categories. However, some did, and the effects of masking are aliased with the effects of the five policies.

However, it is not identifiable in each modeled area on the basis of the available data, namely, detected cases and deaths. Fixing it to 20% (which represents an average of early estimates in different countries from the early studies) is, in practice, no different from assuming other reasonable estimates that vary by area. The model has enough degrees of freedom to adjust the values of other area-specific, partially identified parameters (e.g., the area-specific reproduction rate). With DELPHI, the goal is to predict future detected cases and deaths. If one wished to also calibrate the model so that it could infer (fit) the actual detection probability, more and different input data would be required, for example, random serology testing data. However, such data were (and still are) only very sparsely available among the 200+ areas in which we make predictions. Third, DELPHI does not explicitly account for population stratification by sex, age, or occupation.

With DELPHI, the goal is to predict future detected cases and deaths. If one wished to also calibrate the model so that it could infer (fit) the actual detection probability, more and different input data would be required, for example, random serology testing data. However, such data were (and still are) only very sparsely available among the 200+ areas in which we make predictions. Third, DELPHI does not explicitly account for population stratification by sex, age, or occupation. There can be substantial variation in transmissions within and across population strata, especially age groups, which in turn can give rise to complicated dynamics (Larson 2007, Britton et al. 2020, Gomes et al. 2022). However, marginal modeling of the population allowing some quantities to vary over time (e.g., here γ(t), µ(t)) suffices to approximate any dynamics induced by population heterogeneity. This is demonstrated empirically by the 199 fact that DELPHI (and other marginal models) capture the realized dynamics across U.S. states (Dean et al. 2020) and in many countries. Fourth, DELPHI uses a marginal probability of death (µ(t)) (infection fatality rate) and a marginal mean time to death (cid:1)τ−1 for all compartments, irrespective of hospitalization or detection status. However, it has enough degrees of freedom to satisfactorily predict the total detected cases and deaths in diverse settings and under varying mitigation policies. Fifth, DELPHI assumes that patients participate in the infection process only for an average duration of r−1 ≈ 2:9 days, after the disease has incubated and before d patients are self-quarantined (for undetected cases) or quarantined or hospitalized (for detected cases). However, because R0 (cid:2) (cid:1)α · γ(0) · r−1 d , only the ratio (cid:1)α=rd is identified, and the fitting algorithm simply finds a suitable area-specific infection rate (cid:1)α.
