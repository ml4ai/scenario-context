The goal of this study was to apply a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental mathematical model for prediction of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics incorporating pathogen in the environment and interventions. The next generation matrix approach was used to determine the basic reproduction number R0 . The model equations are solved numerically using fourth and fifth order Runge–Kutta methods. Results:  We found an R0 of 2.03, implying that the pandemic will persist in the human population in the absence of strong control measures. Results after simulating various scenarios indicate that disregarding social distancing and hygiene measures can have devastating effects on the human population. The model shows that quarantine of contacts and isolation of cases can help halt the spread on novel coronavirus.

The goal of this study was to apply a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental mathematical model for prediction of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics incorporating pathogen in the environment and interventions. The next generation matrix approach was used to determine the basic reproduction number R0 . The model equations are solved numerically using fourth and fifth order Runge–Kutta methods. Results:  We found an R0 of 2.03, implying that the pandemic will persist in the human population in the absence of strong control measures. Results after simulating various scenarios indicate that disregarding social distancing and hygiene measures can have devastating effects on the human population. The model shows that quarantine of contacts and isolation of cases can help halt the spread on novel coronavirus.

    "post_context": "  The  pathogen  in  the  environment  is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in  two  ways,  namely:  human  to  human  and  environment to human. The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomatic  IA(t)  and  symptomatic  IS(t)  infected individuals  spread  the  COVID-19  virus  to  susceptible persons  S(t)  with  whom  they  are  in  close  contact.  In addition,  when  infected  individuals  sneeze  or  cough, without  taking  the  necessary  precautions,  the  virus spreads to the environment they are in. Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented. In  the  process  of  disease  spread,  the  susceptible  individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5]. The exposed individual  moves  to  either  asymptomatic  IA(t)  or  symptomatic  IS(t)  infectious  population.  P(t)  is  the  number or  quantity  of  pathogens  present  during  interaction of  human  beings  at  time  t.  The  majority  of  infectious individuals recovers and move to the recovered human population R(t). The  compartmental  model  depicting  the  interaction between  the  human  population,  and  the  pathogens  in the environment is shown in Fig. 1. The  parameters  used  in  the  COVID-19  transmission model are given in Table 1. The model culminates to a six-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations as follows.

The  pathogen  in  the  environment  is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in  two  ways,  namely:  human  to  human  and  environment to human. The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomatic  IA(t)  and  symptomatic  IS(t)  infected individuals  spread  the  COVID-19  virus  to  susceptible persons  S(t)  with  whom  they  are  in  close  contact.  In addition,  when  infected  individuals  sneeze  or  cough, without  taking  the  necessary  precautions,  the  virus spreads to the environment they are in. Since the pathogen  P(t)  is  known  to  survive  in  the  environment  for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to  this  environment  are  likely  to  get  exposed  to  these pathogens,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  the  COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented.

After the latency period, and without mitigating  the  epidemic,  the  number  of  infected  individuals surges,  surpassing  the  hospital  bed  capacity,  set  here  as 8000.  The  infected  individuals  who  exhibit  mild  or  no symptoms  IA  are  considered  to  be  30%  of  the  total infected  population.  The  model  parameters  used  in  this simulation study are shown in Table 1. Since  the  symptomatic  individuals  IS  are  assumed  to be more infectious than the asymptomatic  IA , the transmission  of  COVID-19  through  contacts  in  households, workplaces,  schools,  from  foodstuffs,  or  during  commute rises. This leads to a surge of the virus in environments  such  as  workplace,  school,  foodstuffs,  and  public transport, see Fig. 2b, and consequently more cases of the coronavirus  are  confirmed,  see  Fig.  2a  between  10  and 35  days.  In  this  model  we  take  the  constants  α1  and  α2 to be reciprocal of the frequency with which individuals acquires the COVID-19 from the environment and from infected  individuals,  respectively.  In  Fig.  2  the  model shows that when α1 = 0.05 i.e. there is a high risk of getting  infected  by  a  contaminated  environment,  as  compared  to  an  infected  individual,  the  number  of  exposed, asymptomatic  and  symptomatic  individuals  increases. However,  when  α2 = 0.05  i.e.  higher  chances  of  getting infected by an individual, as compared to a contaminated environment. Moreover, in Fig. 2c the number of susceptible  vanishes  by  the  23rd  day  for  α2 = 0.05  since  many people were infected quite rapidly, see Fig. 2d–f for duration 0 − 20 days. Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for α2 = 0.05 , as compared to when ",

Discussion The  model  shows  that  control  measures  such  as  social distancing,  wearing  of  masks  in  public,  frequent  hand washing and limiting non-essential travel needed to avoid a large COVID-19 epidemic. There is a growing concern that  this  disease  could  continue  to  ravage  the  human population globally since many aspects of the COVID-19 are yet to be discovered, which also poses a challenge to the long-term mathematical modeling of the disease. Limitations This model was designed to look at transmission dynamics so does not describe disease severity and death. Given we  made  assumptions  of  the  parameters  at  onset  of  the pandemic, there is a possibility that the model may overestimate the pandemic at later period of time.
