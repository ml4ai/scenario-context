Even though most of the melting occurs at depth, the meltwater might be expected to rise to the surface due to its relatively low density; however, this assumption is not supported by observations. For example, measurements of noble gas concentrations in the Ross Sea (Loose et al. 2009) and in the Amundsen Sea (Kim et al. 2016; Biddle et al. 2019) reveal vertical meltwater distributions centered at around 300–400-m depth. Near Pine Island Glacier, which is the source of a large fraction of the total Antarctic melt, Dutrieux et al. (2014b) found a large interannual variability in meltwater settling depth, with meltwater settling close to the surface in some years and hundreds of meters at depth in other years. A better understanding of what determines the settling depth of Antarctic glacial meltwater may greatly improve our understanding of ice–ocean interactions as well as their representation in climate models. Aspects of glacial meltwater dynamics have been studied previously. In the Antarctic context, the priority has been to determine the rate and spatial distribution of sub-ice-shelf melting for given boundary conditions and forcings. To this end, studies have employed plume models in one (MacAyeal 1985; Jenkins 1991, 2011; Lazeroms et al. 2018) and two (Holland et al. 2007) dimensions, box models (Olbers and Hellmer 2010; Reese et al. 2018), and three-dimensional fluid dynamics simulations on the ice-shelf scale (Losch 2008; De Rydt et al. 2014; Mathiot et al. 2017). In an Arctic context, where meltwater is generally released from near-vertical tidewater glaciers at the ends of enclosed fjords instead of from underneath an ice shelf cavity, meltwater plumes have been studied using both one-dimensional plume theory and DOI: 10.1175/JPO-D-20-0286.1 (cid:1) 2021 Am"

    "pre_context": "18). The increase in the Antarctic meltwater anomaly over this period may have played an important role in driving the observed trends (Rye et al. 2020). Climate models typically neglect the anomalous freshwater flux due to net mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet: this has increased over the past few de21 (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. cades to around 500 Gt yr 2019). Recent work suggests that the incorporation of this meltwater anomaly into climate models could help to explain the observed trends, resolving the discrepancy between observations and simulations (Bintanja et al. 2013; Rye et al. 2014; Bintanja et al. 2015; Rye et al. 2020). The incorporation of Antarctic glacial meltwater also has a significant impact on projections of future climate (Bronselaer et al. 2018; Golledge et al. 2019). Although there remains some disagreement about the magnitude of the climate impacts due to meltwater (Swart and Fyfe 2013; Pauling et al. 2016), understanding how to correctly represent this process in global climate models is clearly of importance. In climate modeling studies, the meltwater has generally been represented as an externally imposed freshwater flux; this requires a starting assumption about where in the water column the glacial meltwater is situated.

Even though most of the melting occurs at depth, the meltwater might be expected to rise to the surface due to its relatively low density; however, this assumption is not supported by observations. For example, measurements of noble gas concentrations in the Ross Sea (Loose et al. 2009) and in the Amundsen Sea (Kim et al. 2016; Biddle et al. 2019) reveal vertical meltwater distributions centered at around 300–400-m depth.

We investigate the dynamics of such a meltwater outflow by idealizing it as a prescribed, constant buoyancy source F, with width L, applied to the bottom of our model domain. In the real world, this buoyancy source is a function of complex melting and mixing processes beneath the ice shelf cavity; explicit consideration of these is beyond the scope of this paper. In this section, we outline the hierarchy of theoretical and modeling approaches that we will use. a.

For example, F/L depends on the total melting within the cavity, on the spatial distribution of melting (because buoyant meltwater parcels released at depth will lose buoyancy on their ascent toward the ice-shelf front), and on the mixing with ambient cavity water. It also depends on the nature of the sub-ice-shelf circulation, and to what extent this focuses the outflow into a narrow jet as is the case for the Pine Island ice shelf. While F/L could in principle be calculated using a sufficiently sophisticated subice-shelf model, our approach in this study will be to treat it primarily as a tunable parameter.

The meltwater outflow is deflected to the west by the Coriolis force, and eventually reenters the domain at the eastern boundary. Our model domain follows the schematic in Fig. 1. The horizontal widths Ly and Lx are both set to 5 km, while the depth of the ice shelf front Lz is set equal to 400 m (approximately consistent with Pine Island Glacier; see Jenkins et al. 2010). The domain is reentrant in the zonal x direction; free-slip and nonormal-flow conditions apply at the other boundaries. We use 512 grid cells in each horizontal direction and 96 grid cells in the vertical: this corresponds to a horizontal resolution of 9.77 m and a vertical resolution of 4.17 m. We consider the evolution of temperature, salinity, and a passive tracer representing meltwater. Glacial meltwater escaping from underneath the ice shelf is represented as a constant buoyancy source F applied to a horizontal area of length L next to the southern edge of the domain (see Fig. 1). We conduct experiments both with varying L and with L set to a default value of 1 km, which is broadly consistent with the meltwater outflow from beneath Pine Island Glacier (Naveira Garabato et al. 2017).

(2017); we discuss this in the text. the rotating experiment also shows a broadening of the vertical meltwater distribution on this time scale, suggestive of rotational effects playing a mixing role. Interestingly, these results conflict with those of Naveira Garabato et al. (2017), who used two-dimensional simulations to argue that centrifugal instability is a dominant mechanism acting to decrease the meltwater's rise height. As the northward-moving meltwater is deflected to the left by the Coriolis force, a strong zonal jet develops (Fig. 3); centrifugal instability can occur if the resulting anticyclonic vorticity is large enough (z/f , 21; Haine and Marshall 1998), promoting lateral export and mixing of the meltwater.

    "post_context": " For clarity, in the buoyancy source region: dT dt 5 (other terms) 1 l[Tr(y) 2 T] , (C1) 21. This experiment is conducted twice, once where l 5 1/20 s 21 (realistic rotation) and once with f 5 0 24 s with f 5 21.4 3 10 (no rotation). We then conduct an additional set of simulations using a constant buoyancy source, which is set to approximately yield the same settling depth. Figure 9 shows the vertical distribution of glacial melt in the water column after 1 day, for both rotating and nonrotating cases, and for a restoring formulation and a constant buoyancy source formulation. When a restoring formulation is used, in the rotating case the peak is ;50 m deeper than in the nonrotating case, consistent with the results of Naveira Garabato et al. (2017). However, when a constant buoyancy source is used, rotation appears to have no effect on the peak of the meltwater distribution. Since the magnitude of the buoyancy source is a primary control on the meltwater's settling depth, the importance of any other parameters can only be accurately investigated by holding the buoyancy source constant. This suggests that the bottom results in Fig. 9 are more physical, and that the use of restoring nonconstant buoyancy sources may exaggerate the effect of rotation on the settling depth. APPENDIX D Approximate Lower Bound on Net Melting Corresponding to a Given Buoyancy Source For the second x axis included in Fig. 5a, we estimate a lower bound on the glacial mass loss due to melt (i.e., net melting) 23). In the real corresponding to a buoyancy source F (m4 s world, melting is spatially distributed throughout the ice-shelf cavity, and the meltwater that is released loses buoyancy as it ascends toward the ice-shelf front. If the meltwater plume carries a buoyancy flux F by the time it reaches the base of the ice shelf (i.e., the base of our model domain), the smallest possible rate of mass loss that could be responsible for that buoyancy flux would be achieved if all the melting had occurred at precisely that depth.
