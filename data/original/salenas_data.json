The consistency between \nmodel predictions and Ontario statistics before July 2021 can be attributed to the choice of model parameters, \nwhich were based on statistics available then. Model predictions for the second half of 2021 can be used to \nvalidation. The total number of infections, including asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, are shown in \nFig.\u00a02b. The model predicts that by the end of 2021, about 680\u00a0K people would have been infected, half of whom \nare asymptomatic. The cumulative infection curves exhibit the steepest rise in December 2020 and March 2021, \ncorresponding to the two peaks in the new case counts. By the end of 2021, 71% of the Ontario population would \nhave been vaccinated with at least one dose, with 57% fully vaccinated (Fig.\u00a02c). At that time, 11\u00a0K would have \ndied from COVID, with 36, 47, and 17% from wild type, Alpha, and Delta, respectively (Fig.\u00a02d). The year-end \ninfection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750\u00a0K infections and 10.2\u00a0K deaths)16.\nPredicted population dynamics are shown in Fig.\u00a03. The drop in the susceptible population becomes signifi-\ncant after December 2020 (Fig.\u00a03a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment.

The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end \nof spring (Fig.\u00a03d).

COVID-19 mortality rate \u03bcW\nI affects the number of infected \nindividuals who are alive and can participate in the spread of the disease. Because COVID-19 mortality rate \ncan vary substantially depending on health care infrastructure, we varied \u03bcW\nI by 50%. As expected, changes in \n\u03bcW\nI are immediately reflected in the number of deaths. However, compared to other clinical features of SARS-\nCoV-2, the mortality rate has a relatively small effect on the infected population, since < 5% of them die (Fig.\u00a04).\nProvincial policy and pharmaceutical interventions that were considered include NPI that reduce the effec-\ntive disease infectivity (via scaling by \u03bb), vaccination rate (\u03c91), delay between the first and second vaccine doses \n(\u03c92,PZ and \u03c92,AZ, varied simultaneously), and vaccine escape rate (\u03b2W\nV). \u03bb and \u03c91 are varied by 5%. Since NPI are \nmodelled by scaling \u03b2W directly, they have large effects on model predictions (Fig.\u00a04). Vaccination rate has lesser \nbut still significant effects on the spread of the disease. The effects of dosing interval (\u03c92) and vaccine escape rate \n(\u03b2W\nV) are much smaller. Because dosing interval can vary greatly within the population, and because vaccine \nescape rate is not sufficiently well characterized, these two parameters were varied by 50%. The vaccine-related \nresults suggest that among these three factors, an effective vaccine deployment (captured in \u03c91) is the key in \ncombating a pandemic, and success may be achieved even by means of a less-than-ideal vaccine with higher \nescape rate (Fig.\u00a04).

Estimation of\nthe basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining\nthe potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type\nof disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on\nthe clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention\nmeasures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction\nnumber may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions,\nsuch as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can e\ufb00ectively reduce the\ncontrol reproduction number and transmission risk, with the e\ufb00ect of travel restriction adopted\nby Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to ",
